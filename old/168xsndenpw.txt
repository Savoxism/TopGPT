 This is what James English is. Been moron. And today's guest we've got to talk to G. Man, I'm doing it to you. How old, yeah? It's been a while, friend. Yeah, two years. Two years, that long it's been. Yeah. Man, it's crazy how life has changed in two short years. It's only been two years. Two years. Wow. Crazy. Two years, mate. I probably thought that it was me who'd been in a prison mate, but it's yourself. First time for everything. I mean, yeah, that was an experience. Certainly interesting. I've only ever been arrested once before in my life. And then the second time I was arrested, I had to do a nice long stint in a Romanian jail cell. So that was certainly an interesting experience. But all you can do is learn from it and move forward, right? So yeah, there's no secret. Listen, I've had you back from day one. Yeah. ifen ei dgyda ddim yn fwy. A lot of people would have turned their back. A lot of people would have turned their back. A lot of people would have turned their back. You can kinda understand a lot of people fearful. When I first met the podcast you were told to have a fun. I didn't really know what you meant. And I did that you had some fun, a lot of your stuff as comedy and I always meet with people cut off the clips show those clips as something that you're meaning. You genuinely did not mean a lot of the shit you said. I've been accompanying many times now. genyny. Se defeat mae syユtyryg dos gyda pe Yas��'r rhymechu'n gwy stafu gael iawn inhalagu'n gwych.

GREI pensan'n gym fel Barry Mategan ond. o peaillogdan i hynneau  and sarcasm's not allowed and you're not allowed to say anything that could possibly be misconstrued as something that it doesn't mean like the world we're living in is just insane and It's crazy because they truly assume people are more stupid than they are I think most people are very well versed to understand when somebody's making a joke and when something is sarcastic and when something's taking out context and like especially you know what I feel like I think it's like the English in me so I'm half English especially the English That's all we do is take the piss. That's all we do is like say things and exaggerate things make fun of each other Americans are all like Oh my god. What did you just say? It's like that's just our cultures. It's how we are I'm not saying I didn't mean a lot of things I said but It's certainly difficult now to live in the world I live in and that we live in where absolutely everything can be used against you all of the time It's kind of well I think that's why he blew up like he did because he means what he says but He says it in a way that's gonna garner attention so he says Crazy things  That can be taken out of context, but a lot of this stuff is meaningful. Scary. Did you ever realize how big you would have got the most good good man on the planet? What old-way news yesterday? Did you ever see that vision? No. I mean, I knew I'd be big and I knew I had a message. I knew that people would pay attention to it. But the idea that I'd be the come the most famous man in the world, I didn't see. But I think the reason that's happened is because I've become an anti-hero. But to be a hero, you need to have an enemy. And my enemies have made themselves so visible. And I've also called for a very long time the moves my enemies were going to make. And they continued to prove me right. And when they proved me right, they proved their existence. If I sit there and say the matrix is after me and the matrix is going to do this. And then it happens. Well, then they proved their existence. So I am now in the middle of a battle and battles are certainly entertaining. They've always been entertaining. And I'm not just an influence.  I'm a guy who's in grossed in a battle. And I think a lot of people find affinity in my message and understand that me fighting this war is in many ways fighting for all the men on earth. It could happen to anybody. So they've made me bigger and bigger. And it's kind of like the attempt to shrink me and destroy me on the absolute opposite. And here I am. Well, as the matrix to you, it's actually interesting. Because I can ask that question all the time. But there's certainly a cabal of people who have mass influence over the world who are not people we elect or know their names. I would never kill myself. I'll start by saying that. And I don't have a direct beef with these people. That's what's actually interesting. If you're a billionaire or you're an extremely important person for an extremely important family and you're born into this degree of power and wealth, you're gonna wield it and you're gonna use it. That's human nature, right? You can't expect somebody to have that kind of influence and not use it. Totally respect and understand that. But then I become massively influential and they see my influence.  as a counter to their narratives. So, as it's always been since the dawn of human time, when you have a counter narrative or a counter influence, you aim to destroy it. It's always been that way, right? The English and the Scottish, it's counter narratives, and you go to war. So I have a narrative which is countering their narratives that they control, and they feel like that I need to be punished for that. And they're massively influential and powerful, and now I find myself in the position I'm in with a matrix attack. And unfortunately, the law is so complicated in most countries on earth for a reason, right? They don't make the law like the Ten Commandments don't steal, don't kill. They don't make it simple. They make it extremely complicated and subjective and difficult to understand and you need lawyers and all this. And the main reason for that is one, so that certain people can get away with certain things depending on what kind of lawyer you have. And two, so that it's subjective enough that it can be used as a weapon. The law can be weaponized. Yeah, I would argue even though you're probably one of the nicest men I've ever met.  If they were to take the entire book of law and look at it and get legal experts to an attempt to hit you with crimes, they'll find crimes. This could be maybe, that could be maybe, this and his friend, that's a criminal group, and it's all subjective and they just attack you. It's a weapon. It's a weapon that they use to judicial system, unfortunately, is a weapon that is used to hurt people when they get to a certain level of influence. And I'm not the only one who's been through it. I knew it was coming. And now I'm fighting for my life. It's quite an interesting scenario. It's a crazy scenario. For two years ago, your relative, the unknown 200,000 followers on Instagram, private planes, girls, listen to Flash Life, go bought into it a year later, you had six, seven million followers. We look at Conan McGregor, they know we look at Nema, we look at Johnny Depp. Listen, I've been in the front page, call me a woman, beat her a fugue. A woman says I beat her up McDonald's. Luckily, I had the CCTV to prove my innocence. There were no charges. There was no fine, nothing, but the paper still went with fugue.  Yep, lost family members to mother, they put my name to question to try and townlish the name. I'm only a man. This is something that the media and the government's been doing a lot lately and that's why I think people are losing faith. In the government, people have been lost faith in the media because they just blatantly put out lies and things that aren't true, they manipulate the truth. And I think if the media didn't cover Andrew Tate the way they did, like BBC, his name wouldn't be as big as it is now. They're blowing him up a lot more than if they would have just left it alone. And who's changed his life and tried to do better? Tent of you people would tell things from their story. If you're getting friends getting twisted without all the bills shit at the day. See when you're started, when did you realize how big you were getting? From two years ago, like I said, 200,000 followers to them.  And what was that moment you thought? You know what's interesting, what's interesting is I can tell you that me and my brother had a conversation when I was in Dubai about two weeks before I was arrested. I was sitting there with Tristan. We had just been canceled, right? They deleted all our social media, they deleted all our bank accounts, deleted our Uber account, our Airbnb account, our Facebook, our Gmail, and they'd delete you from everything at once. And it attempted unperson you, and that didn't work. We weren't unperson. They made heroes of us, and we became more famous than before. Yeah. And I was sitting with Tristan in Dubai, and we're in this beautiful $40 million mansion, and we have Bugatti outside, and we're clearing outside, and business is going well. And Tristan turns up, he comes in the house, and there's like five beautiful girls, and he's like, oh yeah, just bring some chicks in, whatever, and the waiters are bringing us drinks, and we're smoking shisha, and $500 cigars, and I'm sitting there, and I said, Tristan, everything's perfect. And he goes, yeah, I know. I said, we're fucked. We're fucked. And he goes, why? What do you mean? I said, there's no way, there does life doesn't go this way, Tristan.  I'm 36 right there's no way at 36. I could have just made it and it's fine Something's gonna come Like one of you I will be careful, you know None of us gonna die will always roll the team all this stuff go up the security and all this stuff. I'm like yeah I just had this feeling I just knew Weekly or I'm in a Romanian jail surrounded by cockroaches. So it's it's like It's kind of like the balance in the yin and yang of life. I've always understood that Whether it's God or the universe or whatever it doesn't allow you to just Climb whatever goes up must come down to a degree and I knew that some kind of attack was coming I didn't expect to get hit with this human trafficking is insane it's insane charge. I think that's why they expect to hit something else I mean that's a charge that will Definitely affect the way people look at you and You know people will probably look at human traffic and worse than they look at most murderers but I just  think the story they're giving is so far fetched. I don't see how many people can believe it. If the charges were relevant to the only fans, the company he had a couple years back, then I think it'd be way more believable, but saying that human-tristan were human-traffic and women in order to make TikTok videos so they could take the TikTok money is ridiculous. It doesn't make sense. But now that I've analyzed it and I've been through it, I understand they're trying to slander my name. You can't slander my name with a fucking tax charge. Nobody cares. They're trying to slander my name and make out that I'm heinous, dangerous, bad person because they've been trying to do that with the media for the last year. So that's what they're trying to do and I find massive reassurance in the fact that nobody believes them. It kind of scares me that nobody believes them because now what makes me wonder what they're going to try next.  But also it is nice when you're called as human trafficker by the matrix to wake up. There's a thing though, I don't think he's worried about them killing them. I've heard some other people say that the government doesn't want to kill, they don't care about them. I don't agree with that. I think if they could do it and get away with it, they probably would. Because he does have mass influence of young, the young males, the future military males. But I think because it's blown up so much, he talks about it all the time that if he commits suicide or don't believe if they say he committed suicide, I don't think the government knows that they could not kill him and get away with it. I hope. I can see 10,000 comments of everyone saying, Bollocks. It is nice to see that people don't believe it because I would hate for people to actually believe that about me. And basically nobody does. In fact, I struggle to find anybody who does.  actually look on lot. Most people have no clue that in 2023, the best way to make money on Amazon is not with physical products. I'm underneath all these stupid headlines. Nobody believes any of it because everybody understands and Yeah, we've grown one you mentally big and now I feel like I have a huge responsibility and my responsibility is to tell the truth and be a good person and make sure I say things in a way that they can't be misconstrued. But also now in this particular battle I'm in, I feel like I'm fighting for the rights of every single man on earth. Because what they're doing to me has happened to loads of like you said famous influential men and even worse, not famous, not influential men. How many men are getting wrecked with this garbage that you never heard of? A lot of us. I don't know. Do you know how many I had told my Robinson on with a man called Mo Rami. He was done for human trafficking and try to traffic this girl. The girl made it all up every single bit of it. She gets 12 years just a few couple of months ago. 12 years she got the insurance this man's life this man's son nearly.  un bus Continuington, ac fr<|bo|> y pros.

That's crazy. Seven. How many times since one person to human traffic? Do you understand where I'm coming from? And it's, I mean, you're just telling me about the person time that people who lie are serving. That makes me feel good inside of my heart. So I believe that the moral arc of the universe bends towards justice and may take time. But in the end, people who lie will pay the price. I believe that. I believe in truth. And I'm very patient. And I know that justice will be done. But yeah, it's absolutely insane. And it's insane because, yeah, this is happening to me and the whole world knows about it, but how many men lose custody of their children because they're falsely accused of heinous things, beating the woman or molesting the kids or whatever, right? It's crazy. And yeah, women need protectors. We all agree on that. But I feel like it's a constant balance. The pendulums constantly swinging. We're trying to find the medium in which women are safe to go to the police and make genuine complaints and that men must pay the price. But also, it doesn't go too far. And men can't live a life. And I feel like it's swung too far.  one way. And the bad thing about that is that in life whenever you have a pendulum that swings too far one way, guess what happens? It swings too far back the other way. People are getting pissed off with this shit. Constant never-ending lies about men being rapists. Eventually it's going to swing back to the point where a woman who's genuinely hurt is going to go to the police and they're not going to care. And that's terrible. That's disgusting enough to self. But then whose fault is that? That's the fault of all the women who keep lying. So we're in this situation. We're trying to find this happy medium and it's insanity and there's absolutely no doubt in my mind if I wasn't world famous. I wouldn't be going through any of this garbage. But that's also the way it works because we talk about the matrix and how important people are in charge of the world. You can also look at the world in a far less interesting more benign way. And I'll give you an example of that. You're a prosecutor. You have a job for the government. You're not particularly well paid. You do a job. And this guy stole...  a Mars bar, okay, do the paperwork, this guy stole a Mars bar. This guy stole a car, this guy stole a car. Who? Don't know. Andrew tape, Andrew tape. Do you understand? There's a degree of wow. Prosecutors, they get hard on for a famous rich guy. It doesn't even have to be from the tip, tip top matrix. It can just be a prosecutor with a hard on. Because you're famous and rich. Like a download pro. And it's interesting. So this entire battle, there's so much I cannot say as I was learning why this happened to me and why certain organizations and countries haven't saved me when they should have, etc, etc, etc. But yeah, they save more money. Yeah, but it's too degreeic. The thing, he was born in the United States. And you haven't heard the government say anything about him being held without charge or, you know, the investigation. But Brittany Griner, on the other hand, they fought tooth and nail to get. And she clearly committed...  the crime they wrestled her for was the punishment unfair obviously but I mean why would you fly to Russia with marijuana on you so it's crazy the level of corruptness and favoritism and you know if you don't agree with the United States government then you're on your ass because that's true but I think all men should be allowed to live in relative safety and live a life which is normal the things they've accused me of the human trafficking which is obviously insane but look what the BBC print about me the BBC said that 13 years ago I was emotionally controlling to an anonymous girl I'll probably realize it's as professional you're a man I'm a man all the men watching 13th if this person exists which they don't if this person is not imaginary  13 years ago, I was emotionally controlling. What does that mean? Does that now a days that can mean anything? Everything is your own truth. Oh, it's my truth. That could literally mean anything. And that's all the information they're giving. He was emotionally controlling. They don't give any other specifications, no evidence, no proof, no nothing. The media should not be able to put stuff like that out to the world with nothing to back it up. That's crazy. That's insanity. He should be able to sue them. No, I won't buy you a handbag. Does that mean I said no, you can't go drinking with those guys in the club? Does that mean I said no, you should have been nice to me on my birthday. What did I do? Don't know, who is she? Don't know. Probably never will.  And I put it all over the news and call me a sex criminal. How do I defend myself against such abstract bullshit? That's garbage. But they'll do it to absolutely anybody. They could say the same shit to you or any other man watching this. They could say 10 years ago you were emotionally controlling to an anonymous female. You are the enemy of the state. I used to tell Gettos I played for Manianatids. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. Take him to jail. Take him to jail. That's not actually new. Bro, but that's the thing that's crazy. So even with this garbage start hitting me with human trafficking. So they come along and they said, oh, you're human trafficker. So well, I've never transported. I never kidnapped anyone. I've never restricted anyone. I've never held anyone. They said, no, but you're human trafficker by the lover boy method. I said, what's that? It's where you pretend to love them. So what being nice? So I was nice to some girls 10 years ago. Is that my crime? I thought maybe I did love them. But we're not together anymore. So what? Pretended who said I pretended prove I pretended to that's the  problem with that charge the lover boy method. What is the burden of proof? You even if he says something online about it, like, Oh, I'm using them. I'm pretending to love them. Well, how do you know that? That's not a show. How do you know what he truly feels? That's, that's, there is no physical evidence that can be presented either way. Love. And then what did I pretend to love them to achieve? That might work in civil court. I mean, I pretended to love proof for criminal to make them do TikTok for money. Please listen to this. That's the case against me. I pretended to love girls to convince them to do TikTok to give me the money. The girls themselves have said that's not true, but they throw away their statements and keep them as victims in the file. That that's how insane this is. Never mind. They're saying to you.  by pretending you love them. And the reason all this garbage has come up is basically because they chose some girls I know who have TikTok on their phone. And here I am, human trafficker. The level of insanity is crazy and there's so much more I could say, but unfortunately I'm in Romania and I have to go to court. I don't understand. He's a multi-millionaire. TikTok is not paying him enough, or wouldn't pay enough for you to human traffic someone. That's crazy. And then I have to respect the Romanian judicial system and I have enough faith that the judge is gonna look at this and say, well, this is crazy. It's not human trafficking. But yeah, you get so big and they come for you and they come to attack you. So it's scary. And if they're gonna do what they've done to me, purely because I know girls with TikTok, I'm sure you know a couple girls with TikTok. I'm sure you guys at home know a couple girls with TikTok. Watch out. It's a clown role. What do you think should be in place to protect me more? We think we get it rough.  of the stick. Oh, we absolutely get the rough end of the stick and there has to be some degree of burden of proof. I don't know why with these particular crimes there's no burden of proof. Surely there has to be some legal test. I don't know where a woman's statement alone just is enough. If I if you go into the police station and say I know someone who stole a car. What car? I can't tell you what car. There's no car. There's no video. I can't even take the red plate. Nothing. But I know he stole it. Is that person going to jail for stealing a car? I'm like, okay, so you can't do anything about the car. There's no video of the car being stolen. No cars have been reported stolen. You're just telling me they stole a car. No, go away. It's just this one particular crime. I don't know what the exact solution to it is. I guess. I mean, I have daughters. I have many daughters. And when they grow up, the solution to it for me is going to be teaching them to keep themselves as safe as possible. I believe in personal responsibility for men and women. I don't believe that's such an argument. I believe women and men should both be as personally responsible as possible and not rely on government.  law enforcement agencies to protect them. I agree with that. If something happened to my daughter, heaven forbid. And I find out, yeah, heaven forbid, bro. But I find out she was walking through a park alone at night at four in the morning. The first thing I'll do is I literally, before I plan to kill the guy and find him, because I will kill him, I'll say, what the fuck were you doing walking through a park at four o'clock in the morning by yourself? I'm not going to absolve her of all responsibility. I'm not going to sit and sit and go, we live in a society where men shouldn't rape, and this is all men's fault, and we need more feminism. No, I'm going to say, why did you do that? I would have picked you up. Yeah, that's a huge problem with society nowadays, is there is no self accountability. People have no sense of responsibility. They think that everything should be handed to them. They think they can walk around and do whatever they want, say whatever they want with no consequences. And that's just not how the world is. It never will be like that. So I agree. People need to take self accountability over themselves and they're...  their actions, their mental health, their physical health, everything financially. What are you doing? I believe in personal responsibility for all, and of course there's some scenarios where that won't help. Of course there isn't. But those are the most heinous, violent, brutal crimes where a woman is being responsible and doing the right thing and protecting her safety and is still rigged. Well, in those scenarios most of the men get caught because they're doing terrible things. But all this subjectiveness of I was with a guy 10 years ago, I was in love with him. We live together. We had sex. We celebrated Christmas together. We had a puppy together. It's now been nine years and now he's famous and now he's rich. And I think he once told me something that emotionally made me feel like I couldn't take money from his wallet and I'm been raped. And there has to be there has to be a level of sanity reinstalled. But that's assuming the legal and judicial system wants sanity. If you have sanity, then it's much harder to just weaponize it, right? If you have insanity, then you could just...  to make everybody afraid of it and just weaponize it against anyone you choose. What would you do if you were in charge of the world? I'm not a victim. I'm just crying what's happening to me. Because no crime has taken place. And then I'd be persecuted. And that's not a victimless crime. Of course, my brother and I have suffered. But so it's my family. My mother suffered. My children have suffered. The mothers of my children have suffered. Everyone close to me has suffered. People are suffering because of this. For what? For who? Who are we suffering for to protect who? I don't think a lot of people notice that about Andrew Tate. I don't think a lot of people think about him having a woman at home, kids at home, a mom, or any of that. They just think of him as this crazy dude that runs around with all these different women. And no, he has kids. He's got a family. People who say we're not victims, this is stupid. Who are we protecting? So yeah, there's been genuine heartbreak and a lot of people crying on my side, which nobody seems to give a shit about. Nobody talks about all the BBC and all these garbage.  I'm a Christian MSN, I'm a Constellate Talk, attacking me, never talk about my mental health. They talk about Phillips' Scoth feels mental health. Of course, after two days. Have you ever wondered how millionaires actually become millionaires? And no, I don't mean those platitude answers that they always regret. Days. After a year of attacking me, they don't talk about my mental health. They don't care about my family. They'll just... I forgot about the dogs on my family. Just trying to get everybody in trouble, because I'm not part of the club, right? At Consumer Cellular, our customer service team is based here in America. America? America. Right? Because I haven't sold my soul. And there's been a lot of people who suffered. And I think that, in fact, in jail, I said it to Tristan. I said, we're sitting here in this hell. But everyone we love, at least, has taken care of. At least mom can eat, at least the kids can eat, at least the rents are paid. At least we, you know, we are suffering because men are built to suffer. But everyone we love has taken care of. That gave me some solace. But the way they've attacked me, they didn't intend for that to be true. They intended for me to be bankrupt. They intended for me to be completely...  destitute and destroy it. They intended for me to sit in a cell knowing I can't feed my kids. That's what they wanted to do Just because I've managed to make sure that didn't happen. That doesn't mean it wasn't their intention their intentions purely and truly evil And it makes you wonder who are these people who want to operate in this way? Who are these people sleeping well at night? But uh, I guess the world's always kind of been that way, isn't it? Seeing you run the by-why? That didn't you just see the Yeah, that's a good question. I uh Because probably we're truthfully. I love Romania I've been here seven years. I actually love this country and it's full of good people and I have to be honest and say that 99% of Romanians I interact with apologize to me 99% people on the street police officers correctional officers the people at the court everyone's like sorry, bro. Everyone understands what's happening They're very sorry and it's a good country full of good people. I came here to pack a suitcase and I got nabbed and uh Yeah, I knew something was up Oh  I was more concerned about, you know, some Albanian gangsters or something more than the law, because I know I don't break the law. It's another really interesting paradigm shift. And I think life, as you go through it, is a series of paradigm shifts. It's a series of having your world you've broken and reconstructed. But one of the paradigm shifts I'm going through is that as someone who never broke the law, really, I never really feared law that much, because I'm a law breaker. I mean, COVID to a degree made me understand that you can't be a cuck to the law. You have to be the kind of person who's like, no, I'm not going to ask on get fucked. I understood that much, but I never thought I'd ever be genuinely a target of the law because I'm not a criminal. So I never really feared it. And now I have this really interesting problem. These days you, I hate to say it. Sometimes you do have to be afraid of the government or the law. If you're not with them, you're against them. Be a new hobby of Joe Biden.  If you don't like what he says, he labels you a domestic terrorist. And before I go to a country, I like investigate the legal system. Like, what happens if I get arrested? What's the jail like an Azerbaijan? Because I'm like, what am I getting arrested there? I found out that Japan's legal system's crazy. Japan's got one of the most strict legal systems in the world. They have like a 99.8% conviction rate. You don't get that conviction rate without putting innocent people in jail. You go to court in Japan. You're going to jail. I'm going to jail. I'm going to go to Scotland then, because God forbid, if you ever get the jail, you just put a dress on. Cut about and I'm fucking... Per our pants, we had balls hanging through and you get sent to a women's prison. The system there is fucked. Wow, fucking joke. I worked a kid that raped a 13-year-old in God Community Service. They start to change the law where you get the first one. I think it's under swear to one for free, basically. It's fucked up. The guy raped two women. Rape two women. Put a dress on. That is actually hanging through shorts and they're trying to put men in a women's prison. Because people want...  That's where the United States is heading. There's definitely gonna be men and women's prisons here soon. Sad to say, it's crazy. And yeah, they're letting rapists, child molesters get away. They're trying to make being a pedophile legal. They want to make it a minor-attracted person. I don't know what world we live in where people think that's okay or acceptable or how that should be part of the LGBTQ plus whatever. But we need more God in our country. We need more Christian values in our country. Be a lot better place. Sam, the Bible has feelings. Why are they getting those feelings? And this is the thing that's so amazing to me, so that people who are in charge of the world, the matrix and people in charge of these countries, they do that. They have no genuine concern for protecting women. Which...  Those back to my earlier question, do we want sanity or insanity? Which is what's scary when you genuinely analyze and say, none of this makes sense, we need to change it. Yeah, that's a very optimistic worldview. It's fantastic to view the world and look at our broken systems and say, less sticks to system. It's far more daunting once you understand the systems broken on purpose. It's designed to be broken. They want to convince the world that I am dangerous to women. Me, a man with daughters, with a large sexual history, with no women with a face even coming forward and complaining. With every woman I know who's ever interacted with me defending me. But then like you said, they'll take a man. Which says the Lord. So do they really care about females safety in any regard? No, they're trying to sow a degree of insanity and subjectiveness into a system which is designed to be bulletproof. The whole point of the legal system and the justice system is that it's black and white, on paper, it's not up to interpretation. The good guys go home, the bad guys go to jail, right? As soon as you ingest subjectiveness and.  insanity and chaos into that system. Well, now you got a real mess. And that's what we currently have. I would argue that if I was a transsexual, which I'm not, I know I'm. That the US embassy would have had me out of a Romanian jail within two or three days. They would have called Romania transphobic. I agree with that also 100%. Our government would have been sending troops over there to go get him if he said he was trans. It's. And they would have said that my rights aren't being respected and they would have pulled me out. But because I'm a heterosexual male, they just left me there. But you've says that they have evidence assessment as soon as you had born, evidence flowed. That's the target straight, mostly white men. That's the new enemy of the world. It seems like women give birth on their back, which is as wrong. They give birth on their artificial lighten wishes wrong to cut them.

You can change elections. You're going to become a top cat completely. What do you think about this system? And that's the thing. So for a very long time I've tried to avoid politics. My way to protect myself was I'll avoid politics. I don't really comment. I think most people can guess my politics, but I don't comment heavily on politics. I don't do political shows. I don't comment on politics very heavily. I thought if I avoided that game, because you're right, I can influence an election. I can say right now who to vote for and they'll win. That's extremely scary for me because that means I'm a party target to kill because that makes me a national security threat. I don't think most people understand that once you're deemed a national security threat, all bets are off. If a government says that is a national security threat, they can kill you in the street, they can shoot you, they can put you in jail without charge.  They can spy on your entire life. They can kidnap people close to you and try and convince them to turn Once you're deemed a national security threat. It's like James Bond He can go do whatever he wants to the to the bad guy. It's national I think they made him the national security threat because Without him having the media put all this out arresting him with these charges holding him with no evidence no evidence. They've showed anyone Taking stuff out of the file. They're making a martyr out of him I mean they they are making people who look up to him like him even more and Making even more people add on to that Social security once you have control of the entire youth of a country Well, then I guess you are a national security threat. I didn't intend to be I just say the truth and I found a finity amongst young men But they are desperate for me to not have that control So with that degree of power. I've been very careful talking about politics. I thought  Let me avoid that game, because I don't want to get in too much trouble. And then I've learned now that if you don't choose a side, you just have two enemies. Assuming there's two sides at all. Some would argue there's one side. But if there's two sides, and you don't choose a side, now both sides don't like you. So it's difficult, it's hard. I kind of wish. I kind of wish we weren't living in a world where speaking the truth was so revolutionary that it causes a revolution. What if I said that so genuinely revolutionary? I've said the things that we all grew up with and agreed with 20 years ago. Everything that we grew up with in our childhood about how men, women, how men should be, things we should do, personal responsibility, discipline, hard work. And I said it in a convincing way. That's it. Fuck, it's crazy. So what was the connection with you and Greta Fumburg? Was that any connection? Or was it just blown out of proportion? I think it was blown out of proportion.  because that was the day I came here to pack clothes and then I got arrested. I think it was blown up proportion, but Greta is certainly one of the protected class. I don't think many people at home realize, and I'm going to try and explain it as simply as possible, that once you get to a certain level of fame and wealth, the people who are in charge of the world want to also be in charge of you. Because once they're in charge of you, they can allow you to exist because you'll push their narratives. And for you to join their team, you have to sell your soul. You have a, you have sanity inside of your mind. You're a same person. You're a hardworking person. But you have to take that sanity out and sell it. They'll usually give you a large contract for X amount of million, for whatever TV station or whatever company or whatever product. You have to take the sanity out of your brain, give them the sanity, and then you'll take the 20 million, and then you'll say, yeah, that is a girl with the balls hanging out of her dress. Put her in the girl prison. You're a transphobic and you have to just sell your, sell your sanity. And then you get to join their team. And once you join their team, you're part of the protected,  and the protected class is protected by basically every institution, but especially the media. Look at Philip's Co-Field, guys of groomer. Sexual predator. And look after 24 hours, they're printing photos and leave him alone, his mental health, he's on the edge, poor Philip's Co-Field. Isn't that crazy? Someone who there's actual proof of him grooming. I don't remember. I think it was a young boy. And they are not treating this anything like, Andrew Tate, they're being very kind to the Co-Field, but they're demonizing Andrew Tate with no evidence, none at all. Most of their evidence is 30 second clips from a three and a half hour interview that's taken way out of context. Me 14 months in human trafficker rapist human, I haven't been convicted. Human trafficker rapist human traff-  Rapist, rapist in Romania must go to jail, rapist, rapist all day every day. Here's his mother's house. She perth the rapist. They're attacking me because I'm not joined their team. What most people don't know, and I've tried to make this clear before and I've said it, I've effectively been offered to sell my sanity many times. You don't become as influential as I am with the kind of impressions I get without large corporations becoming very interested in you. I've had very large companies which I'm not going to name. Come along and say we want you to sponsor you. We want you to sell our product. You have to tone down your opinions. Don't talk about this. Don't say this. Don't say this. Don't say this. If you're asked about this, say it this way. And we'll give you $25 million and you'll shake the product around. And I said no, I don't want your money. And they were kind of like, okay, well, your decision. Now, if I was sponsored by a very, very large company, those very, very large companies wouldn't allow the media to do so. Most people have no clue that in 2023, the best way to make money on Amazon is not.  What they're doing because they call the media and say that's our sponsor don't do that. That's our guy It's all a big club all I had to do was sell my Santa E James all I had to do cut my balls off Take the sanny out my mind to take the money But I do believe at a certain point of money. I Mean I'm not gonna brag but there's nothing left for me to buy there's nothing I want I don't have So I don't really care about money what I do care about is I feel good inside when I know I'm telling the truth Yeah, I feel good inside when I say what I mean. I feel good inside when I wake up and don't feel controlled when nobody Texts my phone says you can't say that. I feel good inside when I feel like I'm helping people That's worth more to me than money So never mind in the eyes of God or Allah The truth does matter and uh God will protect you Well, I never sold out and if I had I don't think any of this would happen I think this is punishment for not selling my soul I think that's why they're doing this. Yeah, I'm at this stage where I'm only claiming a lot َ a lot of people have alot of people create the external stuff to fulfil. And that internal stuff is broken and euh witness the series. Apart from e lesson i wanted fame at attention five years ago because i use to see people on magazines and tv. And i thought that looks like their life? Yep, and then unpleasant people would have not realised that s all bullshit. It is. And it is also delayed fortification. If you would have taken that deal and taken that genuinely you would be happy for a week but 2 months in when your here toward some poor guy who lost his housing from genbulling you feel like you feel like you have a piece of shit. thin uw'n am sy' wedi'r ystaf guy palanc yna. Rydych chi'n ubrhau, fi hwy thym ar o winio?  level and destroy art to the point where we don't have a conscience. You have to have no conscience to sell your sanity. You have to be a bad person. That's what's so upsetting about my current position. The people who are attacking me are the bad ones. I know in all wars both sides think they're the good guys, but I have principles and a conscience. They don't have any of these things. I think they know that. I don't think they think they're the good guys. I think they know they're the bad guys. They just don't care. They want control. They don't care who they got to get out of their way to do it. But and we can that's been proved with COVID. COVID is dangerous. Be afraid of COVID. COVID is dangerous. Be afraid of COVID. Don't talk about COVID anymore. OK. Anyway, onto today's programming. They don't believe any words they say. They don't give a fuck. They just say what they're supposed to say is repeatedly like parents. They don't have a conscience. They don't have morality. They're just talking pieces. The same as it when the women was reporting the towers fallen before it even fell. Bro, I don't want to die.  So I'm just going to say, I heard about that very unusual. And that's the thing, it's insane. So we're living in this post-truth world, and now this is all happening to me. And I'd like to think, at least, because I have genuinely suffered. I went to jail, and it was only for 94 days, three months, just over three months. But I would like to say that Romanian jail is about five times of English jail. We can put it down to like one and a half, maybe two years. Probably United States jail, too. You know, the jails in America, for the most part, are not bad, especially compared to Romania. I don't know, that's crazy. They're laying there, cockroaches. Literally 24 hours a day in the cell. He said, he said, you don't get out of the cell, nothing. In the United States, it's not like that. It's pretty sweet compared to what it used to be. Without charge. In English, jail, you could at least leave the room, hang out with the guys, the lads are all right, that I'm in a, just, I don't speak Romanian.  and I'm stuck in my cell. My cell was about this table to hear. This was my room. I didn't leave for night for days. I don't get to leave. I lived in there with the cockroaches. I genuinely suffered. I went through a lot. And one of the things that gives me solace is knowing that I suffered for a reason, at least. And I think the reason I suffered is to wake people up to a lot of things about the way the world works. The harder they push this narrative and the less people believe them, the less credibility they're gonna have to hurt anybody else. So at least, perhaps, there's a good side to all of this. They're gonna try every weapon on me to the point where it's so obvious all they do is lie that this can be very hard for them to lie again. And hopefully it brings some truth and some honesty to the world. And that's I guess where I've been trying to find some. I'll finish the rest of this interview tomorrow. You know, in my point of view, I really like Andrew Tate. I don't believe all the stuff they're putting out about him.  You know, I think he's probably a great father. He's a great person. He's helped inspire many young men and probably woman also around the world. He's successful and I wish the best for him and I'm going to keep covering his story and his content and you know hope, hope everything goes good and core for him. I'm Solis. You
