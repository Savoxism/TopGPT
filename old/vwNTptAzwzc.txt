Let's start with the allegations. Have you raped anybody? Absolutely not. Have you trafficked anybody? Absolutely not. Exploited any women from the Hanine? Absolutely not. But you have admitted using emotional manipulation to get women to work in the web paradise room for you. No. Firstly, let's begin at the start of the beginning. I'm facing charges. The one, the first one you mentioned, the rate one's already start out by a judge. Could you know every person? Secondly, it's very difficult for me to sit here and have a very frank and honest conversation with you while we're in the territory of Romania about illegal cases going on with the Romanian. I have to protect myself. I've agreed to do it with you. I don't want to be as honest as you as possible. But I can't incriminate myself in any way. I have to be very careful what I talk about. There are no charges yet. Correct. There are no charges. There are no charges. And I've agreed to speak to you. But I have to be as honest and frank as I can while also protecting myself and following my legal counsel. So let's talk about what you've said yourself then.  darmaenn swydd hynna i金orthwyd yn cefylluno.

You're telling me that they've chosen a crime which won his hangness, of course.  because it damages the person's credibility, too. You're saying that even if everyone else involved, if you have five people and everyone sitting there saying, no, nobody's hurt anybody, we like it. If we've all worked together, we're friends, et cetera. That's not what everybody's saying. No. Let me read you some of the testimony from the current investigation. Can I finish? One of the witnesses said, can I finish this? You're not answering the question. You're not answering the question. I am answering the question. You're saying, you're saying the witness. You're saying the people who are involved in this, even if they say they're not victims, that they're still going to try and attack me and pretend they're victims. We've been treated as victims by the case that's ongoing. And not all of them are saying that. One of the witnesses says, who's he? He's being asked like that. We can't go into the case. The case is open and active. Well, let's just be clear that not all of the witnesses in the case are behaving in the way you describe. And even those that are, it doesn't bar them from being treated as victims by the prosecution by the case. We have an open criminal investigation. I am absolutely not really sure.  found innocent, I know the case better than you, I know intimately and you don't. I've seen all the criminal files and evidence against me and you haven't, I know the truth of what happens and you don't. And I'm telling you absolutely not really, I've never heard anybody that the case that's been put against me is completely not like fabricated. And I'm never really found guilty of anything. And it's very difficult for me to answer your in-depth questions because we're sitting here inside of the territory of Romania. I am beholden to the Romanian legal system and I'm not going to incriminate myself because you're trying to probe me. You are wrong and we're going to have to accept that for now and talk with something else. Let me read you then what you have said about what you have done. Sure. You have said, my job was to meet a girl, go on a few dates, sleep with her, get her to fall in love with me to the point where she do anything I say and then get her on webcam so we could become rich together. I don't think that's what I personally said. I think that's exactly what I said. No, that's, that's, that's, no, I've never said that. That's something that you found on the internet. It doesn't mean I've said it. And, and again, if any female on the planet has a problem with me...  I strongly recommend her to go to the police and try and pursue me for criminal charges. It was actually very interesting that me, one of the most famous people in the world, who's been vilified by the legacy media and places all over the internet, while everyone is attacked me from every single angle, while federal agencies, in multiple countries, have called over 2,000 women who know me. We stand here with zero new accusations since my arrest, zero. If you took any famous person, any man of substantial wealth, and you called 2,000 women who knew him, you'd find an extra offering to upset somebody who wants money who's upset. They call 2,000 people who knew me and could not find a single woman to make a new complaint. The only complaints they have against me are the initial complaints, which we can prove relies. And that's where it stands. So I'm not going to sit here and allow you to pretend I'm some kind of evil predator. When actually I'd argue the fact that people who've been investigated, who've been in love with life, been investigated too. If you're taking the average man on the street and investigate his entire life for 14 months ago, everyone who's ever known him, and vilify him in the media, and encourage people to come forward for money, and do try to...  contact every ex-girlfriend is on her head. You would come forward and accuse those people of rape and accused those people of rape. I think you would have a lot more, I think you would have a lot more flat than I thought. I'm actually such a nice person that I would never have you in contact. The reason you're spoken to somebody sits your arrest who says exactly those things that with you it's all manipulation. There's an ulterior motive. Is this Sophie? Is this Sophie? Oh, it's Sophie, the fake name, no face, no one has got a story that was invented. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. And what is she here as she accused me of a crime? This imaginary Sophie? She's making the point that there is a crime. Has she accused me of a crime? Emotional or psychological military crime? I've asked you a question and I've allowed you into my house. I'm asking you a question. Correct, but you're not the boss here because I've allowed you into my house. I'm asking you the question. Correctly, and I'm telling you. You get to decide the answers. No, we're equal here. I've allowed you into my house. You don't come here with a position of authority. I'm doing you the favors and the legacy media giving you relevance by speaking to you. And I'm telling you now, this Sophie, which the BBC has invented, which is no face of, nobody knows who she is.  And she did not invent it. Of course not. And she, because you never invent anything. And she is not filed criminal charges against me. What are we talking about here? What did she say? What are you thinking about emotional manipulation? Is the sex industry for your financial benefit? Absolutely garbage. She is not filed for this person if they exist, has not filed criminal charges against me. I welcome anybody who believes that harm the male or female any point in the past to file criminal charges against me. I will fight them. I know who I am, and I know what I've done, and I know the truth. And I know that I'll be found innocent with this attack. The reason I'm being attacked is because of my massive influence. Not because I've ever heard anybody. And if you just sit here and say that everybody around you is saying you're innocent, but that doesn't matter because the state will say their victims, and they're just going to grab everybody who know and call everybody victims, even if they say they're not, and try and put you in jail, you are describing a matrix attack. You're not describing human trafficking. I'm describing women who are going to court to accuse you of right-wing human trafficking. We will see what women go to court in this trial. We'll see which women go to court. Can I finish please? We'll see which women go to court. I'm describing.  dog?

You have said you're the most dangerous man in the world. I've said I'm the most dangerous man in the world. You've also said that a woman's intimate parts belong to her male partner. I'm glad you find that funny. I find it funny that you're sitting here saying that I've said I'm the most dangerous man in the world and you believe that's... When did I say that? I'm asking if you believe it. No you said you said you said you said you're the most dangerous man in the world. Is that some kind of proof that I'm dangerous and my doctor evil now? I'm telling you that it's very upset that you're going to sit here and that certain organizations in the world are going to try and pretend that I'm the biggest force of evil on earth. When I'm genuinely a force for good. I'm genuinely a force for good. No I said. And the reason you're doing this is because of the massive influence I have over the youth and they don't like that I'm telling the youth to think outside in the matrix and do your things like the BBC. You've seen a lot of come here with lonely questions and false narratives and try and paint innocent people as guilty. You said women's intimate parts belong to their male partner. I said...  that if a woman marries a man, she takes his last name and traditionally the man gives her away. I've been pushing traditional religious beliefs because I'm a religious man and traditional beliefs in regards to marriage, which everybody accepted 10 to 15 years ago. That's not a crazy conspiracy theory. If you're going to say that me believing a woman should take a man's last name and marriage makes me the most dangerous man in the world, then you're just going to lose even more credibility than the BBC's already lost in the last four to five years. That's your point. That's your merit. They say that they should be able to sleep with a lot of women outside marriage. That doesn't sound very religious or something. That's not what I said. They should be able to. I said a lot of high value men, a lot of rich men do it. And then we discuss at length on podcasts why rich men do it. And we also discuss why women decide to be unfaithful. It's not a gendered argument. We discuss unfaithfulness as a whole. What are the matrices of motivations for men and what are the reasons for women? Because you have no time to actually watch my content. And understand what I'm saying.  You just come here with a small snippet which we provided to you. Do you want to be a paper? No, completely. You don't have a clue what I say or what I talk about. You never watch my content. You have small pieces of paper, small clips on a piece of paper, you're trying to pretend I've said evil things. And then you're going to say the most dangerous man in the world, which is truly laughing. You said that, not me. Okay. Do you believe in the most dangerous man in the world, Lucy? I'm not answering your questions. Well then we need to change the dynamic of this interview because, and I'll make this clear. I allowed you into my home. I'm doing your favorite, giving you the first interview I'm giving to the public. You don't come here with a position of authority. You're not the police. I don't respect the BBC. I don't know you. You do not come here with a position of authority over me. We are equals. We are people. We're citizens of the world. And we sit here as equals. And I see you as my equal. If you ask me questions, I can ask you questions back. If you come here and sit down and pretend you're the Gestapo and that you don't have to answer my questions, is disingenuous because I don't owe you any questions. I'm asking questions and you don't see them. But I don't owe, no. Now that you are. This is a conversation. And I don't owe you any degree of authority over me. So let's make that clear. That doesn't matter if you're a man or woman or woman or woman from the BBC or the CNN. I'm here to answer your questions and be honest with you and do you.  a favor, but and I'm doing you a favor, but you've come here with other questions, you're trying to pay an error from me, which is negative. I'm asking you, and that's fine. And that's fine. And that's fine. And that's fine. But you're not going to see her say you don't answer my questions because you're not above me. This is also not supposed to be a dangerous person, but an organization. Absolutely. Well, it would help if you answered the question. I've answered every question so far. Let me ask you the question. Sure. You have said that a woman's intimate parts belong to her male partner, and if she goes on only fans, he is entitled to a cut of her income. You are extremely, it's actually very confusing to me why you're going to sit here, take long format podcasts I've done, which are three or four hours long, in context where I sat with only fans' girls, 10 or 15 only fans' girls, where we've been joking back and forth, ignore every comment and satirical comment and sarcastic comment that the females have made, and then come along and say you said this and you're the most evil man in the world. I don't know if you understand what sarcasm is. I don't know if you understand what sarcasm is. I don't know if you understand what calm.  I don't know if you understand what's a rhetorical concept called a sarcastic. I'm saying it was a very interesting talk show. And for you to sit here and say that that is my true core beliefs and that makes me that person is disingenuous. Is it? Of course not. Was it sarcasm? Absolutely. You should watch the show. You were being sarcastic when you said let me clarify. You should watch the show. Let me clarify for the audience. You were being sarcastic when you said a woman's intimate parts belonged to her male partner. No. You didn't believe that. It's that you have it watched the show at length. And you should have because the woman was saying my man's car belongs to me because he's my man. And she was on only fans. And then 20 minutes later when she said she was on only fans, I said ah well you're selling your body that belongs to him because he's your man. And she laughed. She laughed. She laughed and she said yeah that's probably true. If you watch the show, if you watch the show it will make sense. For you to come here with doing no research at all and then say I don't understand what I'm talking about but I've got this piece of paper with a few things.  that's why you're saying the silly things you're saying. You should watch the show, do some research. Do you believe it? You already answered the question. Not really. Of course I have. Yes, I know. I believe it was. I'm asking the question. Do you believe that a woman's intimate parts belong to her male? Of course not. I'm just answering the question. You just answered that. You know, we've done that three times. And does this woman believe that her man's car belongs to her? We do. We do. It's not a gendered argument. I really think that it's genuinely sad that when the BBC has a chance to find an interview me at the end of all this matrix attack. That they don't come here with any kind of genuine openness to try and understand my influence of the world or the things I push or what and try to teach the world or why I'm a good influence on the world because I am an absolutely good influence. And said they come here with pieces of paper with printed out excerpts from five-year-old podcasts, taken out of context, to attempt the same matrix attack on me, which has been attempted endlessly. Every single person legacy media has already tried this and it doesn't work.  I really encourage you to read the comment section on YouTube when this goes on YouTube and you will see that nobody believes a word you're saying. The reason why I'm asking you about these comments is because we've got the chief executive of rate prices naming you individually as spreading a dangerous ideology of misogynistic rate culture. Absolutely. If the comments you make that are leading people to say things like that. Absolutely. Social organizations who are saying that blaming you for increasing levels of misogyny schools that are saying they are having increased incidence of girls being attacked. The female teachers being harassed. If that was fine people. If that was of you and your teachers. Absolutely. That's absolute garbage. I have never, ever, encouraged a student to attack a teacher male or female ever. I preach hard work discipline. I'm an athlete. I preach anti-drug. I preach religion. I preach no alcohol. I preach no knife crime. Every single problem with modern society. I'm against. I'm teaching young men.  I'm teaching young men to be disciplined, to be diligent, to listen, to train, to work hard, to be exactly like me, with no criminal record, never even yet charged in this 14-month matrix investigation. And I'm saying that a men group like me, which are hard working a diligent, as emotional control and stoic, we're going to have a better society, not a worse society, to sit here and say that schools in England, England, which is a failing nation, which has knife crime going through the roof, violence going through the roof, men's mental health going through the roof. And they're going to all blame me because I appear on the internet one year ago, is this ingenuous, it's disingenuous, and also, it's financial success, it's going to be a boogati in a cigar, but it comes with a side order of misogyny. How does having a boogati in a cigar come with a misogyny? Because it's all mixed together in what you teach. You teach the old woman, if a woman comes home and accuses you of cheating, you should hit her with a machete, shove her off. Is that what I teach? That's what you say. No, if you actually watch the thing, it will be a helpful woman attacking me with a machete. As usual, you've not watched the video, taken out a context, flipped it in a trim.  to attack me with a small excerpt. Let me tell you something Lucy, I'm sure you're a very nice person. I'm sure you're a fantastic person but if I were to take everything you've ever said online and just take small excerpts out of context I can make you look at the sergeants. I guarantee it. In fact I might actually do that. And then you're going to see Erin say oh shit I'm on the sergeant is because my condolences have been taken out of context. If you refuse to wash anything at length I'm not understanding. The National Police Chiefs leave for violence against women. The NSPCC rape crisis, safer schools, they are all naming you as being behind an epidemic of misogyny even amongst primary school children. The idea that I've made primary school children misogynistic because I own a nice car. Is that your argument? Is that your argument? The misogyny that comes along with it. Oh, owning a nice car is misogyny. No, it's the misogyny that comes along with it. How does misogyny come along with owning a nice car? Because you have an image of financials. I'm glad you're answering my questions now. We finally got the name. You have an image of financials. An answer in a question. Excuse me. You have an image of financial success but it comes along with  attitudes towards women that are really problematic. My attitude towards women is that women should be protected and provided for it. I've said that at length. In fact, I've said that over 50 times online, you never mention it. I say that my girlfriend doesn't have to work unless she wants to. I take care of her. I die to protect the woman. I've talked about how I stood up and faced a knife to protect the woman. And you want authority over her in the way you have over a child or a dog. Absolutely not. I've said that women should be protected and provided for it. I think it's a turn you want authority over her because if you have responsibility for someone like a child or a dog you say you have authority over them. If you want to go down this argument, we'll go down this nuanced argument. I said that if I have responsibility for her safety, I should have a degree of authority over her safety. Meaning, meaning, and I'm explaining my point. If I'm the one who has to fight and die to protect her, I'm the one who decides how we walk home. I'm the one who decides the route we take because it's unfair for her to say I want to walk through the most dangerous neighborhood in the world but you have to face the knives. That's what I've said. And then you're going to sit here and pretend I'm trying to treat women like dogs, which is garbage. Every single man. Every single man in the world who loves his...  woman, understand that he has to protect her. And every single woman in the world likes the idea of a woman of a man who would protect her. If you were to say to most women home right now, do you want your husband to protect you in a violent attack? They say, yeah, of course, nothing I've said is the thought you said to most women, would you want to lose authority in the relationship to not be treated as a free and legal equal to your family? I didn't say that. I said, I need to have authority over the group we want home. When you compare women and the authority over women that you believe you should have to having authority over a child or a dog. It's not the same because a woman is a free legal adult. Correct. You're equal. It's free legal adult, Michael. But if I had a girlfriend and we were walking home late at night and I said, let's not walk down that area, it's a bad area, I've protect you, everything happens. I want to take the long way. And she said, no, I will. I have to walk this way, even though it's the most dangerous room I must. Then when, then I would say you're welcome to, you could do it, you're a free legal, but I'm not going to walk with you and protect you. I think that I should be able to decide the route because I have an obligation.  And my obligation is to manage to protect and provide for females. Everything I'm talking about is traditional gender roles which 10 years ago, less than 10 years ago, would not be considered outlandish, would not be considered crazy, would not be considered dangerous or misogynistic. The world has changed, and a lot of people haven't changed with the world. Please understand, there's a lot of women at home watching this right now, I'd like the idea for a man sticking up for them, protecting them and providing for them. And just because the world has gone crazy and the legacy media has gone crazy, most people at home are still relatively sane. And these are the people who are going to write in the comments that Andrew isn't saying. They do need to take votes for women with the same kind of magic of the camera. This is a whole world believes these things. I don't know why, but it's a bit of a problem. Same as what I was talking about. They got me a smile on the shaker hands, and they were used one line, one line, like sevens from the black hole. It's fine. It's fine. It's fine.  I'm having a nice conversation with you, so I'm enjoying it. So it's no problem. It's been a fun so far. It's fine. We good? Yes. Tell me what happened. I can do the clap. Now we're good. Thank you. If a man broke into your house and he wouldn't want your house to protect you. There's a difference between peace and peace. If a man broke into your house and he wouldn't want your husband to protect you. There's a difference between conservative values and emotional control, coercive control. We're talking about protections. I'm saying that someone broke into your house and want your husband to protect you. It's not about conservative values or protection. It's what you're demanding in return for that. Well, I'll give you this. I don't know who your husband is. I don't know if you would stand up for protection or die for you. But I'll give you this. If someone broke into this house right now, it was a homicide or maniac. I would expect me and the other men in this room to stand up and face them while you were in the other room in this room could protect themselves. I would actually believe the men should go and engage the attacker. I believe that.

I will.  gast Web組 Czygselor Mho befiu Bar going away, gyda ydy Gell danachайнol andryd ddatblygu y dygeglen gyzeian Felly Brap pim de Все y bilg yfyduluam yr yksgol Dragon Maus豚 diwy Brussels加入ill wneud eu hynny.

I influence Thor, along with many other influencers. And they sign up for your website, which I don't own. And once again, that's nothing to do with me. And you're going to see here, it's said that I made a joke. I made a joke online four years ago, because a woman said that she owned the romance car, and you made a joke. And that means that you, because you have a gaggy, and the most misogynistic, dangerous man in the world, this is going down a path of absolute insanity. It's not true. None of this is true. I don't hurt people. I don't harm people. I'm genuinely appositing people. You go down. I'm renowned. For offensive and conscious. There's no why I'm renowned. I'm actually renowned. I'm actually renowned for helping young men. Because we talk about there's a men's mental health crisis. And we talk about we pretend to care the men are upset. But as soon as I discuss men's issues, it's misogynistic. It doesn't have to be gendered. Just because I believe men have a point of view and men have rights, and men are allowed to think and believe in an act of certain way that helps them internally, that doesn't mean it's anti-female. In fact, I believe it's actually for female. I think what a man.  true to his influence and true to his essence and he's good within himself. He's a positive influence in the world and he's positive for the women around him. Just because I've discussed men's issues, people say, oh, you're an anti-woman. I'm an anti-woman. I love women. Why are so many women saying that when their boyfriend start following you? They experience more control. So many. They experience more abuse. How many? Enough. Enough. Well, the first time I've heard of it. So the fact. One is too many. Of course, yeah. So, in fact, I've seen thousands and thousands of comments and have endless emails from women praising the fact that their sons are listening to me. Crazy the fact that they're listening to me. I think so. I'm saying there's no worry. It would worry. You wouldn't say that. It would worry me if I was genuinely damaging the world. If you just sit here and say, Andrew, you become the most Google man in the world. You have billions of views and one woman. One is now saying that her husband is not the same man she wants him to be. When thousands and thousands of people are saying the opposite. Well, then I would say that that's... What does it actually do with case after case after case with quote after quote after quote with people  You're genuinely concerned about the impact you're having and you brush it off as if it's nothing. No, what you've done is come here with an agenda. You've come here with loaded questions. You've come here with things that can't have context. You've come here with things that you don't understand of Satorra girl. And then you're going to also say that one woman said that her boyfriend changed when he watched one of your videos. And then I don't know what you expect me to say to that. That's fantastic and jokes. That's how you explain the products you've made. For you to sit down. You'd like to apologize for any of that. For you to sit down. For you to sit down. It's fine. No, it's fine. It's easy. For you to sit down and say that one woman said that I'm her boyfriend watched an entertain video. And now he won't do the dishes. Or whatever your argument is. And that I'm somehow the worst most ageless man in the world beside a car. It's just disingenuous. And I'm enjoying this interview very much because this shows the world. It's great. It shows the world the truth about the legacy media because they beg me for interviews. They beg me. You have been begging me for months. Please, we need to be relevant. And then you come here with loaded questions trying to.  paint a picture of me which is completely not only false. I am a good positive influence for the world. The things I teach men are stoicism, discipline, self-respect, hard work, obeying authority, listening to your fight coach, working hard in school, making as much money as possible in your job. If you actually watch the things I say, if you actually watch my comments about women, I've done long podcasts for hours long about females, talking about protecting them, providing them, how I believe it means to be treating their relationship. I've done all of this, but you don't watch any of it, and then you come here and ask me to answer questions, I'll answer at length thousands of times. Since you came out of custody, there seems to have been a lot about your charity work. Correct. On your social work. There's always done the charity work, but now I'm promoting it. There seems to be a real shift. Yeah. I wonder what's behind that. Well, I've always done the charity work. I've been doing the charity work for years. I believe that it's my legacy to think of positive influence in the world, and I've been doing charity work for over five years. Post my incarceration, my unfair unjust incarceration man, post that, I've made it more further.  work I'm doing. But this is again once again very interesting. I spend 25 million dollars a year feeding children, men, male children and female children in Turkey and Syria and Iran and Iraq. I literally spend 25 millions dollars a year feeding children and I'm still the worst man in the world because four years ago I made a sarcastic comment. Because some people would look at that and say okay so before you got money from attracting people to your website by making controversial comments but that might have got you into trouble and so now you're looking for a new market. You're looking for a new market of followers who are attracted by a different sort of persona. I've always done the charity work so that is obviously correct but I have proof that I've always done the charity work so you're wrong firstly. I believe that if you have a lot of wealth you should help people and I'm helping people. I also think it's very very interesting that you could not find another celebrity in the UK or anywhere else who's spending 25 million pounds a year feeding children in more torn countries. I'm doing that I've been doing that for a long time without even mentioning I never even said it and now that I've said  people are going to attack before it and say that it's disingenuous. Just a thing. The person in Sudan who's eating the meal, do you think they believe it's disingenuous? Now I think they feel pretty good to entertain, fed them. And to sit here and say that I'm a bad person now because I manipulate a charity because I'm using charity. I'm just trying to do good in the world. That's all I've ever been trying to do. When women speak out against your online, disagree with what you say. They describe being bombarded with rape threats, with death threats trolling by your followers. Would you like to say anything to your followers about how to behave in that city? Absolutely, correct. I would love to do that. First things first, I've yet to see a female stand up and argue with me online. I don't ever see hardly any, although no women who mess with me agree with me. Secondly, I don't think that anybody who disagrees with me, male or female should be trolled. I don't know if they should be assaulted or attacked. I think the idea should be discussed openly and fairly in the church. It doesn't matter if a man agrees with me or disagrees with me or a female. I don't think my followers should come along and attack her. If my followers are doing that, I'm upset by that. But let's make it very important clear.  That's not my followers. That's the internet. If you're belonging to any video game lobby, I don't play video games And somewhere to sit there and say something stupid. They would be trolled with similar comments That's the unfortunate reality of the internet as a whole. That's nothing to do with me But I encourage all of my followers to open to engage and open discourse and be fair and honest and talk in a way Which is mature. It's not needed to troll anybody. May I or she? Okay To consider whether or not he would like to apologize or give You know an indication of how he feels about the allegations that he has Negatively influenced young people in the UK and secondly I can't read a record But this interview is taking place in your house because you're into house arrest If it were not for that then you would choose another location  So I think that's just what you think. OK, so just a bit on the record then. You said that you've invited us into your house. Right. We're here because you're on the house arrest. Correct. If you were free to leave, we would have negotiated a more neutral setting. Don't you think, as the BBC and the very interesting you come here and discuss the fact that I was put in a dungeon for 92 days and then locked in house arrest without charge? Do you think that's a far more interesting conversation than old YouTube snippets? Do you think that would be interesting? You're here on the house arrest because there's an ongoing investigation into rape and human trafficking allegations against. Correct. I've been incarcerated without charge. I think the rape allegations has been dropped. I've been incarcerated for. Correct. So I'm incarcerated without charge. And I think that'd be a far more interesting conversation than I guess Julian Assange's incarcerated without charge and nobody's interested in that either. So if you actually wanted to do some genuine journalism investigation, you could talk about the fact that an innocent man who was yet to be charged with a crime has had his liberty to prive to him. And I think that would be a far more interesting angle than talking about.  a mett penna beegi ¿dian un ar gyfer hm o gyda angws, cwn ddoest? A ymedd ar am giddu un tree aniniau sut.

I am a positive force of the world when I teach children discipline. I teach the world discipline, male or female of any age. And a lot of women listen to me as well. 40% of the people listen to me are actually female. Secondly, I do understand with my massive influence and I am now the one who was influenced by people on the planet that I do have to be slightly more careful with things I say. I'm not going to disagree with that. The idea that I said something five years ago on a video that got 300 views. So what do you mean by being slightly more careful? I'll give you an example. Some of the jokes I made four or five years ago on a YouTube channel that got 300 views. I would no longer make like what? Like  The only fan's joke, the one you mentioned, repeated. When she said, my man's car is my car. And then she said, she did only fans. And I said, what do you sell to only fans? She said, my tits. And I said, well, those are your man's tits. As a joke, ha ha ha, everybody laughed. The point, the fact that I could do that out of podcasts five years ago and only got 300 views, now I understand I'm the most influential man on the face of the planet. I would be more careful with certain things I say. That doesn't mean that things I originally said were genuinely out to harm people. Do you really believe you're the most influential man on the face of the planet? I'm the most influential man on the face of the planet. I'm the most influential man on the face of the planet. I'm the most influential man on the planet. I think we're done. Here. Thanks, Lucy. It was enjoyable. Nice to meet you. I'm sorry. No, that was fun. It was good. I enjoyed it. Thanks.  might come out on the damage anything.
