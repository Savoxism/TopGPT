A week and a half and I'm putting a week in a Lebanese and yeah, I'm from Sarasota. Cool. And ladies on the couch. Just speak up a little bit louder. I don't know if they're coming in a little low, but yeah, just in case. But anyway, so like this close. There you go. Perfect. Perfect. Yeah, pretend there's another creepy guy on the end of the line and he's like trying to get horny off your voice. You got to talk like right into that thing. So go ahead, fresh, kick it off with the first or actually, Andrew, do you have a first question? Do I have a question? Yeah, for the ladies, ladies, we could spin it the other way around. I don't know if I have a question. I have this really strange feeling. And maybe I'm Maybe I'm wrong. That we're all going to agree on everything. Is that wrong? I have this really strange feeling that I'm going to say something and you're all going to be like, you know what? This guy kind of knows what he's talking about. It's not so bad. But for entertainment's purposes, we need to disagree on something.  We need to fight. So your girls need to say your most controversial opinions. You understand? If I say something and you don't agree, you need to be like, no, listen, bald motherfucker. Shut up. So I don't know what the first question is. Fresh, you hit it. Come first. So ladies, two options here, right? So if you could choose a guy that was so sensible, I could pay for your life basically pay all your bills, but he may cheat because he had options. Or a guy that was a regular job, maybe a little bit boring, but he would never cheat. Who would you choose and then why? We'll start a good question. Yeah. We'll start, I guess, right here. Me? Maybe, yeah, you. Okay. I prefer a guy with a regular job, boring. I'm really fun person, I want to make him better. Why? Because we could both grow together and become that millionaire together. I'm sorry, sorry, sorry.  Why are you lying? I'm not lying. It's the first question of the show. Why are you lying? Would you rather have a Ferrari that works three days a week or a push bike that's always there waiting for you? They're going to drive the Ferrari. Why are you lying? The line was. It's supposed to be a show of honesty. Show us your boyfriend now. Is he a dork? Come on. Come out, Moody. Why? Why the techor's flawless? Why the techor's flawless? I'm not going to. Perfect. What's your pick? To be honest, Yalik, I would pick a guy who had a normal job that would not cheat. In our relationship, I do prefer loyalty. I have that. But what makes you think that he makes six figures and I'm still super happy and he never leave a house. He's always home. How do you define loyalty? Doesn't talk to other women. Doesn't entertain anybody else other than me. Okay. So, fidelity is how you define loyalty. Yeah.  I'll tell you why that constructs all messed up. And girls, I'm gonna be completely honest to you, right? So I've been to 72 countries have been all around the world. The idea of how many women work in the West is completely different to most places. Let me tell you what happens if you go to Russia and you find a hot, beautiful woman with a big mafia boss. Do you think that dude is loyal to her? No, of course not. No, so do you know what he says? I take care of her. She drives it Bentley. She has my children. I know she's looked after. She doesn't hassle me if I go play games with stupid hoads because I come back to her. And she's like, okay, cool, well he takes care of me, it's done. That's how it's done in 99% of the world besides the USA. If you think you're gonna find a man with options who's gonna genuinely, genuinely never, ever consider those options ever, then he's just a low value dude. That's the reality of the game. The reality of the game is if the guy has choices, he's gonna consider those choices. This, I know it's unfortunate, right? But I'm telling you, a man can be head over heels in love. I can love you with all my heart. I can be ready to die for you, take a bullet for you.  But I'll still fuck that bitch. Yeah. Wow. Who know what I'm saying? Yeah. This is where you get confused. People, women show their love through sexual loyalty, to show their love through sexual exclusivity. A man thru shows his love other ways. Yeah. So when you see a man who's crying over the girl, he lost because he cheated. And they're like, why is he crying? He loves me. He doesn't love me. Yes, he does. He loves you. Why are girls tripping over him fucking something? He came back to you. Who cares? My not bitch. He doesn't care about her. Why do you care about her? I have a question. Sure. What you just said. You're saying that who cares? But if the roles were reversed, it becomes a whole problem. Of course it would. Absolutely. Why? Why? If you get cheated, I should cheat, too. You know, like I should play a role. OK, so how about a little bit of this? Ladies, ladies, real quick. Just before Andrew, did you finish your point? Yeah, sure. OK, because I know a bunch of ladies are going to have some opinions on it. Yes. Let's go ahead. Let's go ahead and start with the couch, from our girl Issa.  Go ahead and give your opinions on it if you have if you have one if not then we could move on wait I mean the first question or or no on on Andrew's stance as far as like showing and well, I guess the oh wait Did we go around the whole? No, no, no, no, you know it. Okay. Let's do this right everyone answer and then we'll give our our take as guys I'll shut up. Okay. No, no, you're starting. No, Andrew You go. You go. Okay. I prefer a guy that makes six figures. I don't care who he's saying because at the end of the day I'm gonna do what I want anyways. Okay. Okay Okay, I'm like I don't like sharing so if you're gonna cheat I'm gonna cheat too. Yeah, that's that that's the only way I'm keeping a six figure guy if you go and sleep around I need to have my own options as well. That's the only way to go work Otherwise, no, all right. Okay You try I completely agree with Andrew If you know You see what I'm saying If a guy's taking care of me, you know, um, you can handle what he's doing at the end of the day  I'm gonna be driving that Ferrari. I'm gonna be getting money. I'm gonna be going buying Gucci. I'm gonna be happy. I didn't know who you were going home with. I agree too because I feel like... I don't know. I want someone to be faithful but... I want to be taken care of as well. So I'll go with that too. Okay. It's figures for me. Okay, it's figures. All right. Is V&O? I agree 100%. I prefer a man who makes seven figures. Okay. Okay. Okay. But I don't really consider it cheating. And he's successful in exercising his options. You know, men can fuck other people and still be in love with you. But women can't. She nailed it. Before we do the couch, sorry, she nailed it. It's not... The word cheating is the wrong word. It's not cheating. Because it's cheating if you're like, I really like this other girl. If you catch your man and he's completely in love with some other girl, then yeah, that's cheating. If he has a second relationship, yeah, that's cheating. If he comes home and he's...  He smells a pussy and he's like, who is that girl? And he's like, I don't even fucking know. Sorry, I don't even know. It's exercise. Who cares? Like if he doesn't care, why would you care? That's not cheating. Now, well said. You got another point. The way I see it, it could either be automated or if somebody else could take care of it if he is out on the road doing whatever. Cool, cool. And then ladies on the couch. So, Andrew, back to what you were saying. I'm sorry, I'll cut you off baby. I didn't mean to do that. But I just have to say, that's where it comes where it respected and communication. If you communicate with me, we're good. Yeah. Now, don't overbound it though. Yeah. That's what we're going to have problems. But we're going to be good. So as long as you communicate with me, we good. So it doesn't matter what you make. I'm down for you. No, see, and I respect that because that's the healthy way to do it, right? If you're a man and you're lying, then you're a punk. If you're going to come home and lie to the girl you care about over some dumb bitch, then yeah, you're a punk, right? But if you come home and say, look, I was out last night. I was acting crazy. It was girls in the house. I fucked some girl. I don't know her.  fucking name. She ain't got my number. She must be on install block there. Who gives a share, right? Let's go for dinner. Move on. Yeah, your tips are better. Who gives a share? It's gonna fuck out of you. Then it is what it is, right? It is what it is. But if you're gonna sit there and go, no, I didn't touch your promise. I didn't do it. This is where most, most men make the mistake. Most men make the mistakes. They just lie. And when you lie, you look like a coward. You look weak, right? And if your woman really truly respects you, she's gonna be angry. She might cry. She might be upset. But if she truly respects you as a man and you truly look after her, she thought I'm leaving. Why would she leave the big boss who looks after her over some fucking stupid shit that happens a couple of times a fucking year? Who gives a fuck? The big boss, man. The big boss. Okay. Okay. Then, uh, slim, slim, slim. Okay. So, yeah, I agree. And I agree to what you stand. But times have changed. Women are the big boss now. So, um, put her on the table. You're standing there. You're taking care of her. I have my own money. I can take care of myself. So, if you're cheating, then, you know, I can cheat too. Just have this.  I'm not just talking purely financial, right? A man has a bigger role than purely financial. I'm talking about taking care of you and everything. And there are also sex toys. Who's that? Who's that? How else can you help me? Someone breaks in the house. Get on the wave, you're dildo round. They're gonna help you. They're gonna break in the house. They're gonna get it gone. There are contractors to come out and fix. I can go back there. We can plumber. Yeah. My point is I truly believe men and women are designed to be together. I agree. I believe that men and women are designed to be together. I agree. I believe that men and women are happier together. They are. But if they can keep each other happy and stay faithful to each other, that's where the unhappiness comes from is when the other one steps out on the other. And then that loyalty and that promise that you guys have together is broken. If I sleep with another woman, I am still faithful to you. No, you're not. No, I'm not. No, I am. If a woman sleeps with another man, that's with you. Okay. She's faithful to you. No, absolutely not. Don't say crazy stuff on my phone. I'm a bonkock. Don't say crazy things. Don't say crazy things. Don't say crazy things.  What about the same energy you have to? You're thinking of men and women as men and women have completely different roles in society. We have completely different attributes, completely different advantages. We go through life in completely different ways. You can't compare us as an equal. You wouldn't consider men and women equal in 99% of situations where men are expected to perform. You would not consider yourself an equal if you're rolling with your boy and a guy rolled up and you're trying to hurt you. You'd expect your man to fight, right? That's a man's job. You can't say we're equal when it suits you and we're not equal when it doesn't suit you. We are not the same. We are not the same. It's the reality of the world. We're not the same and the reason women, even though they have unlimited options, they're not running out here sleeping with a new dude every single day is because they won't sleep with a man. They don't have at least some degree of feeling for. That's the difference. You will have some feelings for somebody you would sleep with. I promise you a dude can sleep with a chick and she can get in a car crash and he won't give a fuck. I'm telling you. That's the game. That's the difference between us.  That's a difference. Can I ask you a question? Sure. What if you're married? Okay, but even even if you're married, I don't think really very much changes. I think you show loyalty I really do believe a man shows loyalty in other ways so it can be it can be anything right so Well, he has no gender. Let me give you a box. They say does of course. That has a gender Let me give you let me think of some example and real quick ladies just so you guys know That's just the way Andrew talks so don't be scared to speak your mind and like No, I don't know what I just want to write out there because I could already see some of you guys like oh holy shit So don't be scared like you're gonna attack you nothing like that. Yeah, as long as we have respectful discourse It's cool me and fresh. You're just here to moderate back and jump in if we need to but real talk like you know This is your chance to talk to a multi-millionaire You know, I'm saying so you guys can get kind of get the real talk you know, I'm saying so if you have a disagreement It's okay. Don't worry. You'll have a chance to speak and everything like that But don't be scared you're gonna hit you okay?  I don't want to say that. She's just a very loud, ostentatious person. True. Oh, that is passionate. You're the very good man. It's passionate. You got a point, right? Go ahead. No, slim. No, I think it's a... Lexi? Was it Lexi? No, I don't think slim finished though. Was it she slim? Oh no, I just said that loyalty doesn't have a gender and that it does. I mean, loyalty is loyalty, whether you're a man or a woman. Period. A great area. I agree completely. And a man should be absolutely loyal to the woman he loves. And he should look after him, make her as happy as possible. And he can still fuck that other bit. And she can too. No, she can. Yes, she can. Women are not the same. Let me tell you something. Let me tell you something that I hope you all understand, right? There are actually far less genuinely high value men than there are pretty girls. You can go out and you can go out to the club today and see pretty girls. Wait, can you repeat that? There are actually far less genuinely. And I'm not talking about the guys who front. Genuinely high value men than there are pretty girls. You can go to any club in any country in the world. I've been a-  You can go to any club in any country in the world and see pretty girls. If you're going to find a young, in shape, smart, tall, intelligent, rich man, it's extremely difficult to find. And that man has options. He has more options than a beautiful girl. And I'll tell you something, well, a high value man respects. When he meets a girl that's genuinely right or die as in, I'm with this man. I like this man. This man loves me. I love him. He fucked that bitch, but it doesn't matter because he came home to me. That man has choices. Why would he choose a girl who thinks, ah, if he sleeps another girl, I'll go sleep with some dude. He just, he'll just ignore you. He won't be with you. You're not going to have the best of the best if you're going to think that way. The only girl you don't know won't hurt you, right? Say again. What you don't know won't hurt you, right? He will know. He'll smell it because he's a bad boy like me. He'll smell it. But no, something like right. Something like right. And I'm telling you this is the way the world works. And I'm all saying it's easy. I like you. I don't thank you. And I'm all saying it's easy. For a woman, right?  I understand it can be heartbreaking. I can understand it can be difficult, but it's not easy But it's a competitive environment right? Why would you do that to the woman you love because listen? Let me take something about this option That's why no it's not that there's no joy without pain. There's no sunshine without rain You need up and down. This is how the world works Make a little bit take them to the mall One two bang Life's fun. You gotta be sitting there all day. You could get the I'm telling you you could get the most high-value man The world who ticks every single box if he has no hose and he's home with you every day watching Netflix You're gonna get bored of him any We got Alexi here as well, so I want to speak I miss the whole entire question, but if my guy is fucking a girl, I'm fucking a guy Exactly in a story, okay, can we put her together and believe that? Okay, I mean I agree and disagree because I Prefer loyalty over anything, but this day and age that doesn't exist as  You visited 78 countries that doesn't happen in other countries at all women or nothing in other countries like you said Sorry But yeah, just yeah, no girls don't have any type of rice when it comes to that So you know, I say this is the only way like that is that's just the reality of it So you either take it and leave it if you want a high-valued man as you said that's just how it goes So okay, so what I want to change that what have I changed the question right? Let's assume that every single high-value man across a 10-year span at some point is gonna fuck another girl Okay, yeah, would you do you want him to lie to you or tell it or tell you the truth? Tell me the truth So you want to tell you the truth so you can go out there and fuck some idiot We're even right no, we're not even no, we're not that's absolutely not You've been with a guy for three years who's been taking care of you You're your company has been paying the bills that can ask you he slept with some idiot girl He doesn't care about anymore. You're gonna go bang  Fucking bedrobe with no money in the back Okay, Jane Isn't the girl he slept with at the club of dorks. So why is the girl she fucks at the club of dorks? If you want to talk about why men and women are different we can analyze that you want to talk about why men and women are Please you don't seem to know why please okay, we can discuss it. You don't seem to know why I'll tell you why I want to say this I'm interested one thing I'm noticing is that the ladies think it's if you cheat If you have sex with another woman with them they can have sex with another guy, but Ladies, ladies, we're gonna Amjus gonna break it down why and I've done it many times on the show too, but I want to hear Andrews take on this Why it's unacceptable for women to run around have sex with multiple men, whereas it's completely acceptable for men to do so go ahead Andrew take it away, man You might not like this lady so get ready. We're gonna talk about biology here This is fire now. So let me this first of you make this clear for anyone watching this Let's see let's see I meet a girl I  I'm not saying the first thing I'm gonna do is run out and cheat on it. I'm not saying that. I'm not even saying I can't be faithful because I could. I'm just trying to explain the difference to you in the realities of the world. Female promiscuity has always since the dawn of human time across every culture that's every existed from China to the Aztecs been frowned upon. Every single culture since the dawn of human time has mocked women who are promiscuous. If you were a hoe, you were laughed at. In most cultures, if you weren't a virgin, you couldn't get married to this day in half of the world. If you're not a virgin, you can't get married. Female promiscuity across every culture since the dawn of human time has been seen as a negative. That is not a coincidence. It's because females are designed to meet a man, get pregnant, fall in love with said man. Keep sleeping with ex dude, ex dude, ex dude, pulpen plan bees. Take it out. Take it out the morning after pill and remember.  Moving the stigma, this is the big point. If you're a female in the beginning of her sexual process, there's a stigma associated with sleeping with a new man. If you sleep with enough of them, you remove the stigma. And now it's like, oh, I just fuck this guy, this guy, this guy, this guy. That cheapens you. It doesn't matter if a man slept with 20 girls or 200 girls. He is still the man. If a woman slept with 200 men, she is worth less. This is the basis of the gang. No man has got a marrying a woman that 200 men slammed and threw to the street. So when the problem with the Western world, and it's the Western world as a whole, but it's especially America, women think they have some kind of power. Oh, well, I'll go sleep with the guy. You didn't fuck a guy. The guy fucked you. And wait, worth anything more. I didn't fuck. You think you can get that out of your head. It's a bad idea. Get out of your head. Okay, I have another question. Wait, hold on. I need to address the situation. I need to address the situation at hand.  Situation at hand Yeah, so we'll take turn on the panel Oh my god, so I hope you're not getting angry We'll start with this way We'll start with Okay, yeah, okay, yeah, all right So we'll start with ESA Go ahead, wait, what's the question I'm sorry Yeah, the questioner you want to respond to what you say? Yeah, no, we can skip the interview Yeah, I don't have a really interesting question Okay, Alexi, I don't need her Cool, okay, Red, you got your response, okay, go ahead, Slant Yeah, no, I got a response I was just trying to make sure we all heard the same thing, did he say it? Right, yes, I don't think he's speaking about everybody though Not every female But I mean he has a very interesting point I really don't like how a men just have so much to say about women and how they started and how they're supposed to carry And you degrade yourself by fucking this person and that person How many women have only fans and are married in your relationships? They're out here now So I don't think a women's value goes down  if she is being fucked or passed around. In this day and age, holes are having fun. Holes are getting wiped. Holes are. Exactly. They're in. OK, so the women who are actually doing things that are doing the right thing, they're getting looked over. But the holes are having fun. So I don't think that a woman loses her value if she's being passed around. Only fans I agree with. And also, you said that the nigga didn't fuck you. If I didn't let him fuck me, I fucked him. There you go. That's it. But I'm done. You're slid. That's it. That's it. That's it. Yo. Oh my goodness. That's a new one, bro. I have a very important question. I'm confused on if. No, no, no, no. What's your concern here? It's going to be this way. This way. Yeah, a question. No, I just I disagree with the hose are having fun point because.  don't get waived. Maybe they'll be with somebody who has money, but that doesn't necessarily make him high value. So if I'm a girl popping off and I get waived by a rapper who's still gonna cheat, but he has money but isn't high value. Still not really the same realm. Okay, let's go point. All right. I want nothing to say. All right. Cool. We too. Okay. It's kind of a question to whatever God said. I'm looking at it from this point of view. It's maybe I'm wrong. So if yeah, you're gonna go sleep around and guys don't really give a fuck, he's gonna come back to you. I was trying to say in a perspective of the girl, but not sleeping around with different men. What if she gets another side? Maybe. Why is that still a pro? No, no, no, no, no, no. It's one nigga. Every time you go step out, I have my side piece waiting for me to step out too. Because if you're gonna play like that, I'm gonna play like that with my one man who I'm like, yo, what's the cause not here?  You know say so much wrong with that Let me come through let me see this though is that guy decided to gonna pay your bills is that guy is that guy gonna take care of you You know what though? No, but no, no, this is the truth. This is the truth. I'm listening. Please you ladies Linus I mean this you guys just listen to with an open ear. I mean you can you you'll have your chance to robot You know I'm saying obviously slim. We sell heard what you said Go ahead and you're good. I mean this with all respect and slim Thank you for giving me all your opposing viewpoints. I appreciate that very much. I do I appreciate this question This good. I appreciate it and I and I meet but I and I mean this with all due respect Absolutely no patronization right, but I am compared to all of you a relatively old man And I'm a well-lived man up into lots of places. There's no lots of things you know the most beautiful thing in the world is It's love and I mean this in a non in a non corny way when a man truly loves a woman and a woman truly loves a man And they're together right or die no matter what that is truly beautiful Let me tell you something. Let me tell you something a man can do things that men do  and still be completely obsessed and head over heels and love with his woman. I know as a fat number, what any of you say, if you take another dick, you will never love your man the same. I don't care what lie you try and tell. I don't care you saying all it was just sex. Bullshit. You can't love your man and be sleeping with other men. And a man can truly be ready to die for a woman and sleep with another woman now. And again, I'm not saying he's going to have other relationships. I'm just saying he's married twice, but I'm saying if a man has a woman, and she's truly there for him, and he's out with the boys in another city one weekend, does something, it really truly doesn't matter. And if you think the answer to that is to run around a club and find somebody to fucking jizz in you, you have a problem with how you view the world. Because that is not how you build a relationship that you're going to be happy with in the long term. That's the truth. That's the truth. And make one more point. If you think you're going to get a high-value guy and you're going to say to him, if you cheat, I mean, I'll fuck somebody from a club. And he's going to stay with your...  You're gonna enough lonely you got this not gonna have a no no big G's gonna put up with that shit Would you put up with that shit hell no? It's garbage it's not real I want to I want to just say this real quick for the ladies Uh-huh on the on the panel The thing is is that a lot of you guys think that many women are equal and you know Hey, well if he has sex with another woman I'm gonna have sex with another guy and that's okay if you're dealing with an average guy He might accept that you know what I mean? I always say normal guys typically are monogamous out of necessity But if you're dealing with a guy that's higher status higher income, etc You got to understand that he has the leverage because there's far less of him than there are of attractive women Which Andrew is explaining earlier basics of supplying the men So if you want a higher status guy which all of you guys pretty much described 100,000 hours a year Automatically puts someone in the top 10% of all earners United States not just that's women men gay men Let's be in women everything. So if we're talking about a guy that's over six feet making 100,000 hours a year, etc There's far less of him than of you. So Any other thing too?  I hate to say it, but a key that opens many locks is a master key. A lock that opens any key as a shitty lock. Sex is completely different for us than it is for you guys. We're able to have it detached. Now I know some ladies in here are gonna say, my fuck, the bunch of guys detached. It doesn't matter. Yeah, but on a balance of probabilities, most women can't do that. And you probably have to put, bring yourself to certain space to be able to do it. It's a learn trait for you guys, whereas for us, it's natural to be able to detach from sex. And also I can see as well that there's a kind of like struggle here. So for example, a lot of girls don't want to give up power, right? And power means, hey, you submit to a man and you give it all up. But they say, you know what? I could be a boss, be a two. I could do what I want to. And I could challenge, man, because guess what? I mean, I mean, when you two as well. But a problem is that when you do that, now you're master of energy, you're challenging your amount of authority. And that was like a power struggle. So I would just say giving up authority to the right guy is a lot. Yeah, but this is the thing, the right guy. Because as a woman, this is your actual job. Yeah, right? Your job as a woman isn't, I refuse to give up power. Your job as a woman is, I'm going to find a man worth.  giving up power to. There you go. That's the job of a female. The job of a female saying, you know what, I've looked at this man, and without my help, I've just met him. He's financially successful. He's got this right. He's got that right. He's got that right. His life's in order. I don't have to yell at him to stop playing video games. Everything he's doing is right. Exactly. He doesn't need babysitting. He doesn't need mothering. He doesn't need my help. Right? I'm going to be semi-submitted to this individual along with saying, you know what? I'm going to give up a degree of power to him because that's going to create a dynamic in which he feels powerful and he's happier. I feel taken care of and I'm happier. If you come along to an individual who's truly self-made and say, I'm a boss bitch. I make money. But he's just going to say, yeah, whatever. And he's going to bang you once or twice and that's the end of the game. He's all interested in that shit. Very true. Thanks. Yeah, no, I mean, what it just comes down to, ladies, is that many women are very different. And if you want a guy that's higher status, you're going to have to share him. It's an uncomfortable truth that they have the leverage. Now, if you want a guy that's monogamous, you're going to be a loyal as a lot of you guys define loyalty.  You're gonna have to date down and deal with a guy that's a little less higher status because he's gonna be Monogamous by you know by the necessity. Yeah, and also think about this right most guys Whenever tell you this because they want to just smash you. Yeah, they'll tell you we're telling you the truth because We actually care a little bit now. I just felt something to say sure. I feel like all men cheap poor or rich so Men that's rich in he's cheating on me because I Poor man's gonna do the same Question My things Stayed statement what he said question for us or no no question. Okay. I have a lot to say okay sure Listen with my boyfriend now. I'm very submissive okay Like I do whatever he says blah blah blah blah like I take care of his  whatever but when I want to be sexually satisfied like for me personally I want to have sex with like women Yeah, I mean, but is that okay to a man? Like so your thing you will leave your your boyfriend's presence go to see a girl. Oh, no, no Okay, so for me I'd like we do stuff together often so it's like I don't know like I don't mind But it's like what if I do something by myself with the girl like is that like a problem to you Like a man in general since you're talking so generally So when I'm loving your man. Oh, just you and a girl just in general like yeah, basically It's just me like I say like I'm horny like and I see a fine-ass girl And I'm like wow, I'm attracted to you and I like want to fuck her I guess I know how I asked her this bad you What'd you say? You tell me to my face Okay, go for it Man  Get it! I don't think a man should be intimidated by a woman. Right, that's what I think too. But I also think a man should be worried that he can't sexually satisfy you. For real? No, no, no, no. I'm not saying it. You can't do it as a problem. I'm saying, like, let's say, like, see my boyfriend works for a cruise line, right? And he goes- Carnival? Royal? It's Norwegian. Norwegian? He goes out of town for months. But like, let's say, like, I'm horny when he's gone. Like, what if I invite a girl over? You know what I'm saying? Do you, do you? I don't think that's a bad problem. It's never a man, because it's weird if it's a guy, because I'm in love with him. Oh, no, wait. Oh, wait, wait. You just proved my point completely. Right. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. I don't know. You know what, and she takes them out. She doesn't know it. She doesn't prove that I love my man, so I can't sleep with another man. It's proving my point. And that level is wrong. So, when we can all just agree here, everyone on the street, everyone here seeing at the panel, can everyone just agree just like for the rest of my entire life? If I'm absolutely not as correct, but I've always been.  Please thank you. Okay, one zero to take I 100% agree that like if I fucking other minutes because I actually a feelings for him But I'm definitely but I'm asking like not if I personally like if I like like let's say like Valentina and I I'm like damn Valentina is gonna find oh And I fucker like is that see if you told if you told me about her and I met her and we cool and I know what it is However at the same time I feel like if if I'm out of town and Is this gonna be her? But you know what I might let it slide but at the same time it's kind of like I'll put this if I can satisfy you I feel like damn like like what's up? But it's not even that you can satisfy me. It's just that you're not there It's mental not there. I feel like at the end of the day is all about communication Right, you have a thought right after you got it. Okay, period. That's what I think too. What'd you do? I tell my work I know  I mean, they're working about that. There you go. Whenever I want to do stuff with another girl, I tell my boyfriend, I'm like, yeah. What does he say? He's like, okay. That's okay. My ex was not okay with it at all. That's stupid. He was jealous of T-Pur. You know what? I'll tell you why guys are jealous, because it's not because of girls. Men are not intimidated by girls. Girls, if a man is jealous in this particular situation, I've always wanted to know this. He's intimidated by the idea of you being sexually open. That's what he is. He's like, ah, you're sleeping with this girl, ah, you're kissing this girl in the club, ah, you're talking to people. Yeah, your mind is open to the idea of having sex. Maybe it'll be a dude. That's what it truly is. Don't want to scare the girl. Yeah, that's what I actually. And also, if you can, if you're about it, bring up back to your boy. No, I love that. That way, you can do a thing. No, girls are because then it kind of like submits to that. You know what? It's fun. Because it's like, I get to enjoy both. Like, I'm more gay than that. Exactly. It's the excitement that I like. Girls being there. And but like, sometimes when I'm with a guy, like, it's just like.  I wish I had titties and I don't know I don't know what I really think is a Hispanic thing I see all the time I know the time I mean like the Cubans and the And all the Cubans love it Yeah I'm like Wait I don't know It's not about my They're all swingers I gotta ask wait how old are you again? I'm 22 Yeah you're gonna stop being lesbian soon no more No no no I've been lesbian since I was four I was lesbian before I was gay You're a boyfriend though right? She is She is my ever-eater-grossed pussy I was four years old Oh what the Okay Oh my god I'm so big man I gotta pay a house This is a new tube So let's try to keep this somewhere clean Okay The question so wait Will you have a boyfriend though right? Um yeah this is like one of two boys It's okay I was like six Gradyboyfriends You have three boys I tried like six or seven boyfriends Alright, girlfriends in my life Okay okay hold on hold on hold on Wait wait wait wait Sat-show How many boyfriends do you have right now that you're dealing with? Of course Oh one okay okay I'm very monogamous Okay so you're monogamous to him but you have Girlfriends too right now No Okay so you don't deal with the uh  any women right now. No, unless I find them attractive and I'm like, hey baby, like, can we fuck her? Okay, so you define yourself as bisexual, but right now you're in relationship with a man. Yeah. Question, why a man right now if you're and why not a woman? To be honest, it's because like in this point in my life, like he's the one that I find attractive, but before him, I was dating a girl. Like I've dated more girls than I have men, but it just depends on who I find attractive at that point in time. Very interesting. So does the dick give you, okay, you're right. So when you get dicked up, dick down, right? Like, does that mean anything to you? Oh, yeah. Oh my god. No, okay. So I only have a way to get into my life. But it's like when I choose to let you like, dick me down, I guess, like you're saying, like it's a big deal. I'm like, it's a big deal. It's a big deal emotionally. It is. It's a way bigger video. That's what I'm saying. And that's why it's like when he finally does it, I'm like, okay, great, great, great. But then I'm like, okay, let's bring girls because like I want like a mixture of both. Well, I'm gonna lay it out. That's pretty good deal for him. Trust you. Yeah, that's it. You know what I mean? Yeah, just the last time you dropped them off. You know, like I'm here, right here, right here. Yeah, just the last time you found them.

Remember, who comes with kids or a... Who? Please tell me who. OK, but Beyonce though. What is the thing that... No, no, no. You just said, she can be a place. No, but I'm asking it. Tell me who. What is it that replaces Jay-Z so easily, like the money? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Here's the thing, ladies, ladies. Yes, if you would stop interrupting me, I would tell you. So the reason why what Andrew's saying earlier that higher value men have the leverage is this, as a woman makes more money, it's more cloud becomes more famous per pool of candidate shrinks. She's not able to date...  below her. She's richer than most musicians and most guys don't measure up to her status. Women don't date down. However, Jay-Z can bang an 18 year old all day because men don't give a shit about how much money women makes for her clout or status or anything else like that. So Jay-Z can easily replace her because there's far more attractive women than their R.I. value men. However, Beyonce cannot replace him. So she made smart decision and said, listen, I'm going to get another fucking Jay-Z. This comes with the territory of dealing with men of this caliber. I'm going to accept it and as long as I'm the main chick, I'm cool with it. And the only guy I can think of that she can replace him with. Is a guy in Dubai, but it's probably old. But it's not just money. This is the point. It's not just money. When it comes to the perspective, I get a message. No, but it's not just money. It's not just money. It's status. It's status. How are you going to find a guy Jay-Z as much as I even dislike to do, right? He's the most legendary dude in the music career. She's the music woman. She wants another guy more legendary in music than Jay-Z. Exactly. Like, how? That's what I can say. That's what I can do. Yeah. Just know where to go.  There's nowhere to go so that everything my one sense completely true. Jay Z could just replace her with a harine 118 year old He can do it right she can't replace him That's the reality of the game at the top as a man and I know most women are unfamiliar with that and have They're confused when they hear that because the majority of men don't live in that space, right? But if you're actually competing for a top level man the number one thing he wants to see from you is loyalty Regardless right or die. I'm telling you now. I know high level men who cheat just to make sure his girl won't leave That's the only reason he's even doing it. That's just what the games about can I say something? Yeah, sure go ahead maybe okay. Okay. Let's think like let's say somebody like Britney Spears, you know, okay She's dead in some irrelevant us Boy, you know what I'm saying like has 20,000 followers. She makes like millions of dollars a year But she's dead in him because like he gives her love Britney I know a lot about Britney  crazy is this because that was a bad example. A girl I was seeing about six months ago was obsessed with they took Brittany's money and they locked her up and they medicated her. Watch her on Instagram. I'm watching Brittany on Instagram. I still watch her to this day. So what? She is Craig Craig. Brittany's lost her mind. So Brittany's medicated to how she spends. So don't talk about Brittany. She's dating that dude. He has 1.2 million followers to begin with. And two. She has. She's medicated to Alver Mimes. So don't talk about Brittany. And here's the other thing, two ladies. Women always love to use the exception to the rule or the anomaly. Like the thing is that most women can't date down. Most women refuse to date down. That's why all of you guys, we ask you how much money do you want? You mentioned a man that makes more money than you. What was that? Is that true? Yes, it's biological fact. Women tend to date at least at their level if not higher. Yeah, but this is this is this is your point. Does your boyfriend make more money than you? No. My boyfriend. Yeah.  Until I like graduate from college then only like 10 does no, but my wrongs point is super valid because you have to understand something right female female beauty and I'm gonna throw this in there female loyalty is worth so much money When people say like a billionaire I agree with my wrong a billionaire is above a 19 year old 10 right in in the metrics of how you value people the billionaire He is billions she doesn't but really if you actually value it a billionaire with a boat and a 19 year old 10 who's a virgin are actually in many ways the same value Yeah, this is the reality of the world right? Yeah, so so a model of saying is true if you actually look at what a woman does a woman will never date down But a woman who's beautiful and a woman who is loyal and a woman who knows how to find a man She respects and behave accordingly. They actually have massive value. Yeah, and that's worth the same amount as billions of dollars That's what you consider a high valued woman a high value woman is a woman who was right or died. That's what the whole thing  about since the dawn of time. A high value woman is this. Me and you are walking down the street together. Some guy tries to take her hand back, I smash them into face. I catch a murder charge because I punch like that, right? And this is a real, this is a true story. And she stays with you. And she's in the jail cell. She's there seeing me every weekend for seven years. She ain't touching another dude. Let me tell you something. Most of what you girls are talking about, I'm horny, I'll go fuck this guy, blah, blah, this shit. Why am I gonna catch a murder charge for a chick? Who's gonna go fuck another guy? I'm a jail cell to protect her life. I am doing that. If I'm with a chick, it's for real. And maybe I'm just old now, right? I have playing games with chicks unless I truly believe there's a chance we're gonna be forever for real. And when for real means, I might catch a charge. I'm that guy. I might do it. If you can't look at your woman and know with certainty, she will wait for you as long as it takes. What the fuck you buying dinner for? This is the trick. So you're talking about fucking this dude and we're equal and I'll run here and fuck this.  I'm gonna entertain. That's the last thinking of a million years, I'm gonna entertain in a million years. You're so cheap, don't hear them. It doesn't, let's get this. You gotta think about what you say with open mind. It's not cheating. It's genuinely not, and you know what? If I had a woman who was truly for me, I wouldn't even be chasing other girls. I'm not even saying I would do it. You guys are thinking I'm out here saying, if I have a girl on a cheat in every week, I'm not saying that. My point is this, if I did, if I did, it would be in no way comparable to a female having sex with another man. In no way comparable, it wouldn't be on the same page. It would be a completely separate event. It wouldn't even be comparable. They're different things. I got a question for the ladies right now. I got a question for the ladies, okay? So guys, so let's pretend, right? Let's go into a dream world, okay? Mm-hmm. All right, dream world, okay? I take you on a first date, right? And let's say that, you know, I'm not exactly your type, but good enough for a first date, right? So you show up on a first date. I got a helicopter there.  I give you some flowers, we go and do a tour of Miami, go fly over the city and everything else like that. Then I say, hey, I got reservations for Nusrarette, for some of you guys that don't know, that salt-based restaurant, right? Thousand dollars, stakes and all that bullshit. We go over there, we get some stake. Then I take you shopping, you spend $10,000, et cetera. And this is the first day, you don't know me. You know what I'm saying? And I've done all this stuff for you. But how would you feel? You know? You feel good, okay. But real talk, would you fuck me that night? Probably. Yes. Oh, yeah. Oh, that stuff for me. Yeah, to be honest. But I know what. It depends on how hard it is. You don't have to, you don't have to, but. I know the point my runs making me. Yeah, I know what I think that's true. I've had guys that have taken me to expensive restaurants that I didn't vibe with and I did not fuck. And I've had guys that have taken me to cheap restaurants that I did live with that I didn't have. Okay, the point of the matter is, you know what? Thank you for saying that. I think so. How, why did...  Did you not fuck those guys that took you to those nice places and spent all that money on you? Because they were weird and awkward and just like I didn't like my emotional connection with them was not enough for Okay, translation for the woman East. She did not respect them right because the guy went ahead and gave his resources for free for no god damn reason He had no sauce exactly so ladies So if I take you on a crazy date like that spend all those money Yeah, but the thing is is that nine out of 10 times a guy that spent does the most on a first date like that that you barely know You're not gonna respect them. You're not gonna fuck you're not gonna want to fucking you're not gonna me arouse by him etc I'm not CSS okay, well Yeah, but if he has balls he take you somewhere cheap He wouldn't need it. He wouldn't need a helicopter You would need to do all that extra shit. So the point is this ladies you guys could say on paper Oh, I want a guy to bring me flowers all of a shit. No, it doesn't work because nice guys finish last for a reason They finish last because women don't respect them women only fuck guys that they respect first so that that's what it's got to be So with that said if I part ways with my resources time  I am in attention for free, right? By taking you on these exclusive first dates and you don't even fucking know me, you're not gonna take me seriously. That's exactly how men feel about women that give sex away easily. You know what I'm saying? Cause I had to give you guys an example. You go on a first date with a guy and shows you all this extra shit. You're like, hmm, this is fun, but I'm not gonna fuck this guy. As a matter of fact, you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna make him take me out on three or four or five dates. Yep. So I can continue to get free things and see I see some of the girls here laughing cause you've all been on dates with men that you had zero intention of fucking, but you went out with them on multiple dates. That's true. Correct? That's exactly how men feel about women that give sex away very quickly like that. And I hate to say like that, but I had to give you guys a comparison cause you guys think it's apples, it's apples and apples. No, no, no, it's apples and oranges. What about guys who give sex away quickly? Okay, men don't get us to the battle. We're different. Oh my goodness. We're different. We're different in every regard. I don't know how else to explain this. We're different in every regard. Why are we not equal? Why are we not equal? I'll tell you why we're not equal. Biologically.  we're not equal. You could have children. I can fight right? We're different. Do you agree that we're biologically different or do you think you're as strong as men? No, of course not. Okay, well there you go then. So there we go. So we already have a biological difference. So I'm the other protector and I'm like the brisk. No, we have a biological difference. And if you have a certain biology, wouldn't you agree that your biology lends to your mentality? Right. Okay, so we have a different biology and a different mentality. Do you agree? Yeah. Okay, so we're not equal. Um, dumb. Next. I have a question. Um, for the men, what do you guys consider a high valued man? Is it looks? Is it money or is it both or I mean, what's your opinion on that? I'm just curious on what you guys as a man thinks a high value man is. I'm gonna go first CEO or me. Yeah, you can go first. You know what I truly think a high value man is. A high value man is doing something which nearly okay, it's a few things, right? So there's there's the obvious evolutionary triggers. The easiest way to be a high value man is a man who's capable of violence. We look at it from a biological trigger. Doesn't matter if he's got muscles or he's big or he's tall, whatever. Women understab-  from a biological perspective, they like a man who can fight. It doesn't matter if your man had money, a Ferrari, everything. But if you knew for a fact, if any dude stepped to him, he'd get sparked, you wouldn't want him, right? So that's the first thing. But no, you need a man to fight. But really, truly to answer your question, I think the true value of a high, the true marker of a high value man is a man who could say no to pussy. And I mean this on a genuine level. Here's the problem, here's the problem you girls don't understand. All the lower level dudes, you say, I don't want a high value man who cheats, stuttered out. If you got a lower value guy, how's she not with anybody? He'll fuck anything. He has no choice. If you get high value guy, at least he has the option to say no to something. Wait, what's this nigga? Is he saying, I mean, is he saying my name? I don't know who this guy is. No, my fault. What the fuck? I don't give a fuck, we're doing a fucking podcast.  my friend get out of here. Chris, get the fuck out of here. How did he get in here? I don't know. Fucking weirdo. What the fuck? He's trying to fight you? He's trying to fight you? You need to try to fight me. You're trying to fight me. I think he's trying to fight you. Oh, fight. Oh, it's not a fight. I just want to see what the fuck he want. I thought he just said he's trying to fight. No, no, no. Oh, there's a fight. Oh, shit, guys. He's going down. And he said I'm a world fucking four-time white. Wow, no, no. Stop. It's world champion, James. It's world champion, James. Dogecoin. Dogecoin.

What are you saying? What are you saying? You put me on the spot. Oh, going back to what you were saying, what I was saying before is like, if I take a girl on an extravagant first date, her losing respect for me. Whoa, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, I really hate to interrupt. Yeah, what if they hate me? Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. I thought men and women were equal. There was a crazy dude.

And it's completely fine to have respectful discourse. You know what I'm saying? So arguing is healthy. And also, let me just define myself as well. It's baby. Yeah, go ahead. So they said on Twitter, I don't like black girls. I actually like Slim. So he's a way. He's a way. He's a way. He's a preference. And it's not race contingent. It's person contingent. Exactly. This is Billion, 50 dollars. I got mad respect for, say, LOL's definition of testosterone. Okay, real quick. Vaccine. Yes or no? Okay. Honestly, honestly. Hell no. Okay.

It was too quick for them, so okay miss Colombia part two Yeah, okay, so yeah, yes or no no, no, all right cool, um, Miss Kenya no, but if you want to do it do it all right You see  Personally speaking as a nurse, I had a COVID already and I'm not getting the vaccine. Oh shit. Okay. Uh Um, personally actually I don't have it because I don't want to have it because I feel like I'm a lab rat. Cool. Red cool. Yeah. No. No. Hell no. Okay. Slim. No, but my family at home. They're all vaccinated. Okay. Um, Lexi. Oh, not get the vaccine. Hell no. And then Isa. Well, I worked in a medical office. So I would say no, but they force you. Okay. They didn't force me at all, which is honestly insane because I was actually doing I was first hands with doing the COVID testing and doing that literally hands on. Mm-hmm. But I would I wouldn't personally do. I don't like. I don't like saying medicine at all. Even when I'm sick, I like my body to fight off natural. Okay. Let's change the topic of this thing. I'm just gonna have the ladies ask Andrea a question. No, no, I mean, because we can't say in the word. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, ladies you got some questions. Just to go. No, drえ. So, ladies you got all the other questions. any drições yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Nobody knows you. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yep. And you get a set of different sides of your hospital, we'd Tanpa's. Yeah. But people like the shit about their medical staff. Yeah. Yeah. I think life was a disaster. no. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And this also  Tell no from you to write. Oh, wait, oh, that's it. Say, say, say, say. I wanna get Andrews. We'll just call it CV19 for YouTube purposes. Served. 19, yeah, beer bug, yep. Why would I get a vaccine against something that can't hurt me anyway? Because you're not all that good. Why would, that would be infantile. That would show that I have fallen for the propaganda. Mm-hmm. Because there's been nothing in human history which had a propaganda spin and a PR company like Barebug. I've never seen a global campaign to convince the world that something that isn't dangerous is dangerous besides this particular disease. And I don't see why I should take an experimental vaccine for something which I know can hurt. Hang bangs, boom. Okay, so ladies, we're gonna turn it over to you guys. We'll start with Issa. Questions for Andrew, more of the panel. The panel. Before the whole crazy dude came in, I was asking on what you considered a high value man, but you guys kind of got it. So I just really want to know your. So Andrew can ask, but.  about a little bit. Yeah, but I had before we, uh, before we were going to kill that guy, but he left this fine, he left peacefully, no one, no, no, no, no. Okay, no, but you know, or how would you kill him? No, no, no. Not, not, not, not the game. Like, chained or get on, come on, man. Oh, no! Let's demonetize woman. Second, easy. Okay. Uh, go ahead, Andrew, you got it. High value man is all subjective, right? If you're, if you're a lower value woman, you can find a lower value man, a high value man. It's all subjective. And a lot of this stuff his black and white and we talk in black and white and we miss out the new wants on purpose. But truthfully, the man can make you feel happy and you feel truly contented with that man and you truly respect that man. Then he's a high value man in your particular case. That's the truth. It's hard for us to sit here. It's easy to talk alpha male and say, be eight, got 10 male, he's a loser or blah, blah, blah. But the truth is, if he can make you feel happy and you feel, you feel like you respect that man and when you smile in his presence and he's a high value man to you, that's the truth. I can tell you all the things you are. As a man, what do you consider a high valued man?  the kind of man I respect. Yeah. Okay, so the kind of man I respect is a few things. I came from absolutely nothing. I came from a single parent in government housing. I had no car even at the age of 20. I was running to the gym. And now I got 30 in, right? So I believe if you're a man and you're dedicated, you could have as much money as you decide to have. So if you're broke, it's 1,000% your fault. So you need money. That's the first thing. The second thing is I believe a man is physically capable. I want to make something clear. I don't care if it was one man or 50 men at that door. I was ready, right? And that's not me talking tough. That's me understanding my role as a man. My role as a man is, does all these see a problem? Well, we're gonna do hype. We're gonna go to balcony. Right. You understand? So bravery is bravery. Bravery is one of them, but the easiest way to be brave is to be capable. You're capable than your brave, right? So I think if you're a capable individual who's prepared to defend his woman to the death, and you can make sure that your woman always has a house to sleep in and food to eat, then you're a good enough man for most...  women. You understand what I'm saying about. But obviously, there's levels to the game. But that's basically it. If you're a dude who's waking up and you can't pay the bills and you can't do 10 push-ups, you're not a man. You're not a man. You're not a man. That's the reality of the guys. Cool. I would say, hey, value just means, for example, it's kind of like, I don't want to say it's like a metric. I would say it's to individual it themselves and like, what their mentality is. Because I feel like when you're high value, you understand, you know what? I need a network of people to help me with goals and dreams. I need a mule saying to have a certain type of like, you know, thought process in terms of like, if you're a high value man, you know, for example, you can't work for anybody else. You know that you have the money saved up for rainy days, bad days. You also know as well that like most people are not going to be on the same wavelength. So you know, like distance for yourself from certain people. And also as well regarding how you guys that they actually understand that a lot of things in this world are propaganda and not real. So if people like that are high value because they understand that what the world really is. And for example, they also understand that.  They create their own destiny. They don't fall into anybody's you know way of life. But they can create it. Do you think a good good looking man is a high-valid man? No. No. No. Absolutely. Like that's external. I'm talking about like the internal. Yeah. Okay. It's the mentality of the guy. I don't mean man is somebody who can take care of you, but also just like be there for you. You know what I'm saying? Like not even like the man I want. I'm not your point of view. Yeah, it's my it's this for the guys. Yeah. No. I'll just keep a simple man. Competence creates accomplishments, which creates confidence. You have these three things on a perfect trajectory. That's going to lead to success and other endeavors in your life with your physicality, your financial income, etc. So those three things typically someone that's in good shape that has their money sorted everything else like that has these three has these three things in place of some degree. You know, I'm just to keep it nice and simple. What about you Lexi? What's your question? Andrew, do you prefer a woman with higher status or an average woman? It's actually a really good question. That is that's very good question. A female woman status.  does not offend me in any way. It would not offend me. I would have no problem being with a famous girl or a normal girl. It wouldn't offend me. It wouldn't make me more or less attracted. I wouldn't be more attracted to a famous girl in any respect. Do you know the number one thing men look for in a woman? Do you know what that is? I do not know. Yes. For personality. That's brains. What quality of a person? Loyalty. Loyalty. Who said loyalty? I did. Boom. That's all a matter of really interested in it. Yeah. It does. I'm telling you now. I'm telling you now. You said everything. I just want a woman who's just down. No, but it's not dumb. It's not dumb. It's not dumb. Down. Down. Down. Yeah. I'm just you and just you. Because in the modern world, let me tell you something about the world. Only 20 or 30 years ago, every woman was loyal. Everyone was down for their man. This is all all the things you're saying that disagree with this is modern new think. It's new think. You think it's like, oh, I'm new. It's all brand new. Nobody knows the future of it. It's never been tested. We've never seen how civilized.  Exist over a long period of time with this new This new paradigm of how females think right and the olden days the woman was down for her man That's how it always was and always will be and I tell you something now as me as an individual I know how good I can make a woman's life and I won't waste my time making a woman's life good if I truly don't believe She's not down for me because I'm not thirsty for sex right I can go without sex. I'm not a little bitch You know I can go without sex. I'm not gonna be like oh I need to bang. I need to bang I'm not one of them dudes right? Yeah, so if I don't think she's genuinely down for me She'll be there whether it's going up or going down even though I know I'm the guy who will never be I'll never be on the ground Right I'm too smart for that but still I out of respect for myself. I'll look after her when I know she'll look after me Anything can happen to anybody I can get caught up in it in the case I'll go to smash that dude in his face and went jail today. You don't know how life works now I would have to do it now you We can't afford me to go to jail bro But this is the point if you don't have a chick beside you that you  Truly believe is loyal, truly believe is loyal. Yeah. Then why would you even look after it? And this is the number one thing high-value amount of looking after it. If you find a genuinely high-value man, a genuinely, and I'm not saying, don't say this to no loser because it'll abuse you. Don't say this to no bum. He'll take advantage. Fact. But if you find a real G and say, you know what? I respect all you've done. I respect what you're doing. I'm here for you. No matter what. Please don't take advantage of me. If I feel too used, I will leave. But as long as I feel respected, I am always here for you. Period. That's the kind of shit you need to say to a man to keep him. You don't say, if you touch that bitch, I'll bang a dude. Because I ain't gonna work. No, because it's like, that's exactly what you need to say to a man. Period. Because that's the truth. And you agree with you 100%. I am, I make something clear. I am zero percent interested. I am zero percent interested in touching a girl out of a connection with. Zero percent. I'm at that level now. I'm not chasing sex and clubs. I could go to a club today. It's been a half a million dollars.  But I don't want to right? I want someone who I genuinely know if I had a problem, she would be there. That's what I'm actually interested in as a man. So all I'm interested in is loyalty. So the woman's not loyal. You're like fuck that bitch. Yeah, fuck that bitch. What do you consider loyalty like someone that doesn't cheat on you? No, no, fucks other people in as a loyal. No, but okay, so fucking other people's easy, but also I truly believe. Now I'm about to get talked to. I'm just saying, they're ready. You're ready? I'm about to get talked to. No, I'm about to get talked to. Right? But I believe if a woman has a man and she truly loves that man, she doesn't need male friends. Talk to them about what? What can you talk to them about? You can't talk to me about it. You know they want to bang you. You know they do. You know they do. That's a whole new thing. That's a whole topic. Okay, hold on, hold on, hold on. You guys all think you can have platonic friends? Let's start with from the couch move on. Absolutely not.  No, no, Lexi can't man it wouldn't be only friends with any type of interaction Central sexual I'm gonna say no because all my male friends. I know that for a fact would definitely bang me No, no, okay slim I Disagree I have a male best friend that I've been Friends with yes, I'm a very long time and I've actually lived with a male roommate for three years Okay, save that for one second. Oh, what about you miss Vietnam? Yeah, no, they can't be platonic friends. I only have gay male friends. Okay miss Columbia You cannot if you open your legs for them, don't fuck you. Okay, okay Completely agree. I don't want the cap miss Kenya. I know you depends depends and that will answer why I said it depends Okay, so you to yes or no, it's my choice whether I want to fuck you So if you want to be my male friend, that's your choice. Okay, so but we're saying platonic, which means non-sexual for me No, nobody's non-plusonic unless  Okay, fair enough. Right? No. Okay, so we got, I think what, like, two girls that think that men and women make people with ton of friends? Yeah. Miss Kenya and Slime, they're too nice. You done that girl, you're a big one. You did that girl. You did that girl. You did that girl. We got it, you did that girl. We got it, you did that girl. We got it, you did that girl. Yeah, okay, no one ladies, no one. No one ladies, ladies, ladies. And you know what? Let's play a game. Yeah, let's do this. I want to play a game. Go ahead and text your male friend and tell him that you're horny. Let's see what happens. I'm horny where you at. Oh, my phone box. Oh, get it. Oh, shit. Yeah. Oh, I'm going to be there. Oh, if you even up right now, you're on top. You're going to have to press people. Okay, what? I don't understand. Why not? I don't understand. Why not? I'm not able to control our sexual emotions around. That's the way that I was. That's the way that I was. That's the way that I was. That's the way that I was. I'm going to be there. I'm going to be there. I'm going to be there. Listen, listen. Please stop interrupting people. Yeah. You guys get a while annoying. Yo, chill out. I'm not ready. All right. You may be able to take control of it slim, but not him, which is why she's about to prove it.  the right occasion occurs, even though you might say he's just a friend, he's been waiting for a chance to crack in the arm and say, you know what, baby, go you good? Boom, that's it. So text him, text him. Let's see what happens. It's not you. Put it back. Damn, you're an addict, bro. Put it down. God damn. Are we calling her to tell you? Oh, he's saying time, you're gonna tell him. You're gonna tell him. He's saying time, you're gonna tell him. He's saying time, you're gonna tell him. Everybody needs to wait. Hey. When am I supposed to ask him again? No, if you want to fuck. Are you horny? You want to fuck? No, if you want to fuck. Are you horny, you want to fuck? Are you horny? Are you horny? Are you horny? Do you want to fuck? Yeah. Yeah. Oh! He's terrible. Oh! Oh! He's terrible. He's terrible. Oh! He's terrible. Yo! He's always saying, because he knows that he's on bed. I'm on a cup. No, no! No, no! Oh, Miss Kennedy, look at Shake, you now. She's on a cup. No! I'm trying to tell them we are best friends and we do not fuck. We're not interested.  They don't believe that that's not what happens. The poor is his mouth. He's a man. You've all seen it. She was defeated. No, we just lost friends. Like that. Yeah, no, no. You just said he had earlier. No, no. When you ask my mom, I just love a fish for it. Like I literally just love a fish for it. And Amy, my best friend, that's what I hear you say. I just want to let my hair you know, but you didn't say that earlier. All right. OK, man. I love you, gang. All right, Miss Kennedy, you text them. You tell them you're horny? Oh my god. Yeah, see? You said it. You said it. She's nervous. She's nervous. No, let's sit. No, let's sit. No, no, no, no, no. It's definitely not sad. Wait, I said it depends. Y'all, then let me finish my statement. All right, go ahead. I had this exact topic yesterday in the room. It was 10 guys and five girls. And we had this topic, OK? And some guys agree with you. And some actual guys are like, no, like in one.  I gave an example of that's why he gave me like a different perspective and he said he has girls and guys that he's known for a long time And he has some home girls that he grew up with from when they're like kids And he would never fuck and they're attractive as fuck But he would never fuck because he values the friendship to where he doesn't want to cross that boundary That's what he said that's good Because but guess okay here's problem right here's problem a lot guys, right? Well, we've hold their sexual energy because you know what they don't want to put that they want that they want you But deep down skin rejection in the cravis of their soul They want the booty. Let me give it. Let me give you another example Let me tell you why male friends annoy me right because what I think is happening is this I understand because I understand what you just said You said made a really good point she said it doesn't matter what they want matters what I want So she's saying look I can have male friends even though I know they want me But I won't allow them to have me so I can exploit them which which is smart from a woman I  understand that right? It looks nice for you though. It makes sense but let me make the point. For me, male friends are about respect. Yep. So if I have a, if I park one of my 17 super cars outside outside a club, right? Listen, Lambo's outside. And dudes are trying to break in. Even though I know the locks, the alarm, the immobilizer, it's solid. You can't steal Lambo, right? But dudes are trying to break in and I see it. Am I gonna allow them to try? No. So if I have a chick, even though I know she won't let them smash. Even though I know she knows what they're about. And even though I know she's loyal to me, I have respect for me. Out of, it's not jealousy. It's territorialism. I'm not jealous. I'm territorial. If you want me to truly love you, you are my girl. I know one's gonna be allowed to even try. Even though I know you won't let them. Do you understand what I'm saying to you? It's a territorial thing because how am I supposed to have a chick I truly love and care about when every dude in the world can just hit on her? Even if she says no. Just hitting on her.  If you want to go to the club you can go with me. You want to go to Maldives, baby? I'll take you to Maldives, or you want to go? I'll take you anywhere you need to go. You know what I'm saying? You don't need to be talking to no fucking door. Man, at the end of the day, the woman controls the narrative. If she wants to fuck him, she will. But like I said, I've had a really good relationship with my best friend for two years. So I'll tell you the truth. He's fucking terrified of you. Yeah. That's the real, that's why I got to put my hat on right now. He put on the hat. He put on the hat. But even, okay, so without that room, yeah. Let me just say this. Let me just say this. From the way that you speak to him, you are the authority in that relationship. In their relationship, that's true. I'm an authority in every relationship. Oh, see? Well, okay. So when you deal with him, you're definitely the boss. So he knows better than do it. But what I'm saying is this, if you came home one night drunk, like, you know what, I'm feeling it. Like, let's do this. He was mad. He was mad. Because remember, you have this thing. How about it? What was the question? It doesn't matter about a one. You're a man. You're going to what? Too funny.  So if we are friends, why? No, no. No, no, no. We're talking about it. We're talking about it. We said we're not friends. Hold on. You know, you're not having sex, right? You know why he's your friend? Why? Because you said he's your friend. If you said to him today, you know what? Fuck that shit. I want to fuck. Now he's not your friend anymore. So you're right. It is a choice, but you're setting the precedent here, not him. And this is slim. Let me ask you, don't you think if you had a man that would be disrespectful to have a man hanging around you who you know wants to fuck you? Do you understand what I'm saying? I'm talking about just a respect. I understand your control. I can't. I understand that, but at the same time, I can't control who wants to fuck me. I can't control that. You can control if you're around them or not. But you can't. I have your respect. But I can't control how someone feels about me. So you mean I can't be around them because I think he wants to fuck me. I have a man. You know. You know. You would know. OK, I have a question. Slim, how would you feel, right? Let's say me, you were dating, right? And you come over all the time. Sorry, I want to hit drops. I hate to drop. I love Slim, Aless. Yeah.  Slim honestly, she's coming at it. She's like, I like this. I like this. I like Slick. So that's where we're dating, right? You come over. We have fun. We just smash, right? And I say it. But deep down, you want to have relationship. Well, I'm playing this game. You know what? She keeps coming over. I'm kids, smash it. I'm just playing the game for as long as I can. But deep down, you want you want to, you want to, you know, commit a relationship. Now, how does that feel to you? It that was you. How would you feel? I feel like the man controls the narrative about a relationship at the end of the day. Yes. But deep down, you know that I'm not gonna come, uh, come into you. You keep coming over. So how do you feel about that? I would rather know that than to be led on that you're interested in, you know, like, I rather it to know like that than for it to be something else. Okay. But put it in reverse. All right. Imagine your friend that is your friend right now, right? Deep down. He wants you. But because you say, or you keep it at a certain level, he can't. It's kind of the same thing because the thing about this, he wants it. But you.  You don't allow it. But, Subrissa, you want a relationship, I don't allow it. It's kind of like the same parallel there, does that make sense? It does, but it doesn't, but I'm gonna let you have it. It's just, it's just that, I don't know. The thing is, Slim is that you, like you're the authority figure in the relationship, so he's even scared to challenge you. You know, I could tell just from the way the combination. And the way you spoke to him, I saw him just, Slim is a G. Slim is a G. You spoke for him, you could touch. And here's the thing, you know what, I'm gonna have to say this real talk. You're not gonna find a guy, unless he's like super fucking masculine. Yeah, no. To be able to deal with you. Because like you're a sort of yourself, you have like this A type personality. And I could already tell you, without a big reason why this guy probably got friends on in the first place as a pry because you're just too soft to stand up to. That's what it came down to. That's why he friends on him. So for you, you're gonna need a guy that's like super like, yo shut the fuck up and stop talking. Absolutely. That's what you're gonna need that type of guy. Absolutely. But here's the thing, I'll be honest with you, Slim. Most guys don't aren't gonna want to have to fight with their girl, man. It is not about fighting.  It's about like you said communication in respect. But here's the thing It's not it's not it's not it's not it's not a level of dominance though slim You're at a level of dominance that a man is gonna have to rise to damn near hitting you to get you to comply Yeah, but it's high value man. That's what that's what I'm saying like And what's scary? I want to get there No, it's not scary, but you're not gonna play with slim She's going down to me what you don't play with Okay, so I need to be But no, it's right and I believe in being submissive but at the end of the day, right? You have to give me a reason to be submissive and want you to be submissive off-brain It's dead punch most guys are gonna go that far Not it's not though, and I feel like it's because you don't know me. I'm really a real I'm a Libra I'm a I'm a But no, I'll say this right she is right. So minutes of the wrong guy does a bum makes no sense So you're right at a certain point, but you're kind of alpha those. That's kind of tough  I think that's bullshit. No woman says I need, you know, I'm submissive to the right guy. That's like me saying, well, I'm only a man to the right girl. You know what I'm saying? You are. You are. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Ladies. When you see me day to day, right? I'm wearing high heels, fucking address. I'm acting feminine, whatever. But if I find a right girl, I'm masculine. That's how you guys sound right now. That's how I'm masculine. I'm not a man. I'm not a man. I'm not a man. I'm not a man. I'm not a man. I'm a question for you. I'm a question for you. You said you're a man to the right girl, but when we're having a concert and Andrew is talking about like, no, no, no, I'm making fun of your guys as narrative saying I'm submissive to the right man. Because what I'm trying to say that is that women like to be able to say, hey, I'm only submissive and or feminine for the right guy, but that would be ridiculous if we were put on the other side and say, well, hey, you know what? I'm feminine most of the time, but I'm manly and masculine for the right girl. That's ridiculous. You know what? I'm for the first different. A different. A different. A different. A different. A different.  I respect my runs point. I know what he's saying, but also a whole bunch of bummed orks out. This is true. I get that We'll take advantage of a submissive girl every time who don't need who don't deserve so that's why women have to be Mascullective about who there's the many of your in a relationship with them then you are Medicine, though you wait real talk the horn you ain't gonna go on a date with him unless he meets a bunch of prerequisite So what's on a date with the guy and not be feminine because a lot of girls will want a date It's still be masculine something they sometimes things can go sideways Yeah, but but you get the point of trying to say is that like women say oh well You got to you got to approve yourself to me and then for me to be submissive et cetera I get that I understand that but what I am saying is that a girl will go on a date with a guy and still be a bitch Kind of and like try to test them you know what I'm saying and it's like and it's like they they Going on a date and dating are two different things going on a date is not being submissive to a mid being submissive is a relationship Like it's the thing is you're not being submissive to a date somebody  You're dating being submissive you're being submissive to your man That's ridiculous. What if you go on a date? I don't understand So be in a relationship Let's say you take me to dinner. I'm not gonna be submissive I'm not gonna be submissive But you're not but you're gonna expect me to be masculine and pay for it. No. Yeah Exactly If you were paying me to dinner, you're paying me your paying for the meal Here you're inviting me, you're paying for it I'll pay for you But here's a problem lady, here's a problem Women want to be modern when it suits them But they want the man to be traditional at all times. That's the craziness I'm not not gonna be guys for doing what it is but like my thing is this if you're gonna go on a date with a guy Right assuming you like it I mean you're not trying to get a free meal which some girls do that But what I'm saying is if you're on a date with a guy and assuming you like him Why would you not be feminine off start instead of playing these games? And let me try to be masculine off rip and see if you could tame me and all those other bullshit Most a lot of guys are gonna be like Brian gonna you know, I'm saying like I'm not gonna deal with this like this is crazy Because that's like she still expects you to be masculine and men And we're gonna show on a date and be like hey, how you doing? Huh? Okay?  But you know what I like you know also to be masculine now that's crazy What I'm saying is that women pick and choose right they want a guy that's traditional But they don't want to be traditional women. That's the reality You know what I'm saying? And if you want to be modern that's cool be modern But don't expect the guy to be traditional with you so in other words if you guys want to eat you know This equality thing for dude, you know attacks you don't don't expect us to protect you You know what I'm saying because you don't want it you want to be modern right you want to be equal 50 50 Right it sounds crazy when I say it like that But it's it's crazy because a man's roles are always static But a woman's roles are always negotiable. That's why it sounds crazy when a man doesn't adhere to his masculine burner performance Mm-hmm, and all I'm saying is that it's ridiculous to me that woman say I'm submissive sometimes I'm submissive to the right guy blah blah blah Well if you go out with it on a day with a guy he's the right guy because you picked him Yeah, but I don't think you're going to day 4 reason no  I actually agree with my wrong, but I think the problem is I think it's a defense mechanism and I think women date too easily I think it is a defense mechanism That's true and also real quick just hit 9,000 light viewers for the first time 90 I got a lot to go on that video Kimmerin 7 now they don't do non-chucks. Yeah, yeah, hey, what called do not charge? Yeah, man, guys like to go on that video right now like the video or else skills, we're gonna Shit, okay  I'm going to take off the diamond. Okay! I can't resist this. It's like the high-press. Hit him. Hit fresh it. No, nothing more. Hit fresh. Like hard hard. Hit fresh it. Oh, yeah. Oh! Oh, yeah. It's like that. Oh, yeah. It's like that. It's like that. It's like that. It's like that. That's it. That's it. I'm going to hit it. Come on, move. Come on. That's it. That's it. What is that, yeah? Yo! Yo, roll to it! Yeah, you guys are Ninja watching. He punched the ship? B-Puzz me too? I pressed the button. I pressed the button. I pressed the button. You're a shit. Alright, so uh... Okay. We got this. Slim, Slim, you got a question for... Wait, wait, wait. You want to know what's your name? You're a Ninja? Slim, do you got a question? I have a question. You have a question. I just speak it out of the spinach. Alright, Slim, go ahead, you got a question. Okay, so uh... Tastes had something early in the show that really kind of stuck with me. Okay.  I had phones on. Give me a second. OK. No, wasn't bad. And you mentioned something about love. You said love is everywhere. Love is most important. Most important, it makes the world go round. To me, it seems like love is a one-way street for you when it comes to a male and it comes to a woman. If a man and woman are in love, are in love with each other, why is it OK for a man to step out since a man can't, all men cheat. But if you are in love, like you say, love makes the world go around. Yes. Why can't love be a one and two? Why does love have to be one and two? And maybe a three. OK. I can give you two answers to that. OK. So the first answer, no, no, no, no, no. Who said that? So the first answer is the boring one, right? So there's an evolutionary and biological reason why men do what they do. Do you know that since the dawn of human time, and this has been proven in genetics, and 99.  percent of women have reproduced and only 38 percent of men have reproduced. You know what that means? That means that 38 percent of men had all the women. And I'm trying to say that animalistically, you have to look at humans, right? We have society that tells us what to do, but we're also animals. And from an animalistic perspective, all primates, besides humans, every single one, the alpha male has more than one woman. You girls, you may not know you agree with me, but you agree with me. If you see Chris Brown in the club and you're playing with Chris Brown, do you think Chris Brown's loyal? You know he's not. No. But you don't care because he's the alpha male. And the point is that from an animal perspective, women from every primate species has always expected the alpha male to have more than one woman. This is a biological that's been proven in genetics. I just proved it with the Chris Brown point. It's been proven. That's the first point, right? Who even is Chris Brown? These holes in it, loyal. No. Is it the song you sing? Second thing. Second thing. I understand what you're saying about love, right? And I completely understand what you're saying about love. But and we've gone over this with the...  point about how a man can truly love his woman to be a sups another girl, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. Let me ask you another question. To be a man that a woman respects, and on average, you have to be intelligent. Would you agree? You have to be intelligent? You have to be wise. Right? You have to be smart. You have to be brave. You have to be capable. You have to be competent. You have to have done amazing things. Capable of doing amazing things. You have to be motivated. You have to be ambitious. You have to do lots of things. All a woman has to do is be loyal. What's actually harder? No. What's actually not asking a question. I think what's actually harder? What's actually harder to pull off? Stick in by your man and say, I won't fucking know the dude. Or going out into the world with no inherent value. Because what you don't understand is women. Women have an inherent value, right? You're beautiful. Slim, you're beautiful. Men want to talk to you no matter what. If you're a man who you don't get your shit together, no woman gives a fuck about you. Thanks. You need to get out there. You need to do. You need to get money. You need to be smart. You need to be strong.  to be intelligent, to be funny. You do, as a man, you have to go out there and get all this value. So I'm asking truly, if you had to choose, which is easier, I think being loyal to somebody is much easier than going out into the world and doing all those amazing things to actually become a man of status because the 99% of men hate shit. And you know it, and I know it. So I'm saying here from my point of view, if you're genuinely, and I'm gonna make this clear, don't simp for a loser, don't be submissive for a loser, don't let no bum cheat on you. I'm not saying that shit. I'm not even saying that a real G is gonna cheat on you all the time, but I'm saying, if you look at your man and say, you know what, this man takes every single box. And I truly feel happy when I'm with this man. And I truly love this man with all my heart. And he fucked this stupid bitch one weekend. Am I really gonna leave him for some other man who I don't love who's gonna fuck a bitch anyway? Bam. That doesn't make sense. That's my point. You wanna say where I'm coming from, Slim? Do we agree finally? No.  You want something to say with him saying? I'm chilling. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. She's all I can. Okay, I'll say that. So I'm just simply put, man, men must create their value. Women are born with value. That's just the reality, man. Each and every single one you guys opens up your DMs right now, you guys are gonna have 99 plus dick offerings. Us, we are not gonna get nearly as many options as you guys, man. So you guys have to sift through the BS for the quality. Men want the quantity, simple as that. Okay, Joel, real comments. Okay, Josh Gomez, Joel Gomez summary. A good man is not a harmless man. A good man is a dangerous man who has under control. Very true. A B 50 R should women's carrier strap. Well, you ladies want equality, right? God made man, cult made the meek will get training though. Okay, 100 R's, serousse, serro, as a, I'm 21 Indian guy, six foot one white skin broad shoulders, going to Canada for masters of machine. Do I have a chance in the dating market? Yes, my friend, you're asking a wrong question. Okay, pen 50 R's, broad take preaching on loyalty. God damn, having someone who is loyal to you has.  Your back 100% is a top three feeling and he 100% right on having plutonium health friends facts boom and then journey a hundred hours Billy a bill in Melinda gates just to God the force was the point of a high-value man getting married in today's Progressive Sorry, sorry, sorry who says bill this is this is where people give you confused right? Bill gates is a high value. Okay. Yeah, he has money, but he fails in every other metric Back this is what people don't understand the easiest way to be high value is not to have a hundred percent of one thing Have 75% of everything. Yes, you know have 70 have 75% of everything. There's no reason why Bill gates should be fat He's like he could get Jimmy train or gonna your bill gate. Yeah, like this is what I'm saying like and another thing And this is really important. I think every woman here knows it every single time a woman goes he's boring I just didn't get along with him anymore. It didn't work. What does that really mean? He can't fuck yeah, yeah, yeah, you can't fuck He's too busy on his computer  program and bullshit like a fucking door She left here you're fucking nerd. What if you bring to the table the same thing as that man brings What if you guys are both millionaires? What does that give him an excuse to cheat? No, but value isn't prime mayor Okay, money is an easy way to measure value Do you know why we use money as a way to measure value because money is in numbers? Because and humans think in numbers you understand, but values actually far more than numbers, right? Value is far more than numbers when you're with a man and you can genuinely and you know what it's usually instant Usually you're with a guy and you feel the energy and you just know something's different about this particular individual Like that value isn't just about numbers on a screen values not just about money values not so easy and platonic and black and white We just write it down. This is exactly what it is But if you're truly with a high value man and it is different because some girls like sensitive musicians Some girls like kickboxing rope champion millionaires four times four times  But you know what I'm saying, right? You know what I'm saying? So we always talk about money. I wouldn't consider about Bill Gates to high value man. Would you fuck 66 year old Bill Gates? No, maybe not. Would you fuck him? Negative. So he's not. No, I would. So he's not a high value man anyway. Of course his chick wants to leave him, right? Okay, he has cash. But you know what about the world we live in? A lot of men have enough money to take you for dinner and buy you a handbag. Who gives you shit, right? It's about more than that. It's about a lot more than just having money, right? It's about a lot more than that. So fuck Bill Gates. Pussy ass anyway. Windows shit. Pussy ass. Oh my goodness. Pussy. Pussy Bill Gates. Listen, bitch ass. Oh shit. Talk you shit, Andrew. I use a Mac. Oh my goodness. That's so tough. That's awful. I got it. I know. Okay, so go ahead. What's your question? Hmm. Go ahead, do you have something there? What just shortly described to me your most either heartbreaking or toxic relationship or anything like that?  Oh shit. I feel like there's got to be one in there. Oh, yeah. Got a real deep. Whoa. That's a good question. Got to give him a minute thing. Oh, okay. Mine was talking to you. And why? Okay. No, but I've had relationships. I'm an old man, right? I'm 34. Oh. So I've had relationships in the past where the only way things were positive is if I was truly dominant and truly aggressive all the time. Because you have some women who really want to be put in their place. But truthfully, me as a man, I don't mind doing that now and again. But sometimes I like to just come home and say, Hey, baby, how are you? I like to chill. I don't like to come home and threaten to beat the shit out of the bitch. You never let me. Every day. Wait, wait. Three days a week is fun. You know what I'm saying? Maybe three and a half. Yeah, you know, maybe five. You know what I'm saying? But like there's a couple days where I'm just like chilling and I'm trying to chill. So my most toxic relationship was probably a situation like that. But I've always been very fortunate in the fact that I have.  my brother and I live with my brother. And even though we have plenty of money in a big house now, we still live together. And I'm already have companionship. Like, I have a woman asked my life that's gonna be a compliment to my life. And I'm not gonna sit around and chase the girls, gonna act stupid or cheat on me, et cetera, et cetera. So I've never really had anything like toxic or I've never been heartbroken in modern history. None of those kind of things. But I certainly wouldn't want a woman to have to fight with. I have enough stress in my life. I have to fight men in the cage. I don't need to come home to a fight. You understand what I'm saying? Cool. So that's Colombia. No question? Nothing. Next, okay. DR. Well, we've heard all of our favorites, ex-presitions. Oh, shit. And we like him, Ben. Now I want to know. Oh, shit. Oh, my. Let's get it. Oh, my. This is the first time. Oh, my. This is the first time on camera. This is the first time on camera. Oh, my. And you're taking a group. Go through this whole process. So go ahead.  What is it let's hear Andrew I'm gonna get DR on no pad real quick so she could write this down Surprise baby My answer Maybe I'll show you everything That you style whatever keep it simple okay for me you know Okay, all right Miss Kenya  this question is it's more general but also more to as the guys the girls can answer as well so it's I've always wondered so if let's say you're dating somebody right or you're you're about to you're engaged or you want to marry somebody and your family or your friends don't approve them what would you do okay she got that arranged marriage that they're trying to force out four so you know what they do I'm very serious I'm very curious to like hear people's perspectives of you really like this person so much but like when you like let's say like y'all like my own brings a girl over to you fresh and you're not you're like not bro I don't think she's you know what I'm saying she in the one she ain't the one like what would you what would you do more in such a suit and then it's not only here most of your guy friends are like I'll be honest like me and fresh really don't do the monogamous thing yeah we don't but let's let's  We did do it. I would just ask your question. I would say why I would do is It's on me. No, sorry. Okay cool What I would do is that I would say look at this point. He's a man. Guess to make his own choices Mm-hmm. I would just love bro. But you mean you I think it's a good bet You got me a call. Yeah, but do what you gotta do. So I let him know how I feel about it But he's a man. He's making his own money. He's doing his own thing who might say a bro don't do that You know what hey bro? Here's my opinion you do what you gotta do But what's gonna happen is after consequences of going on that route. I'm here for you bro That's what it really is so yeah question on top of that. So let's say he's to this to say would you want to hang out with him when he's around his girl And I Like we go on this you gonna say so it's she's like a bimbo annoying chick, and I know she's not worth anything to him Personally, I would want to hang out high water, but because of him oh hang around Yeah, I'll respect for him  But uh, Roto, I would try to avoid her as much as possible, but if it comes to that, to like last scenario, I'll be there. I wouldn't wife a chick that my friends hate anyway though. Yeah. I mean, she's a big deal. But you really, really like her. No, she doesn't. But they don't fuck with that. See, here's the thing, the woman's got to conform to my reality every single time. So if she, if she has annoying bad habits that piss me off, she's going to change them. And I, and I truly believe that a man can turn a woman into something that he'll create, but it doesn't work the other way around. If a girl turns a guy into some, he's, she's going to be loud. Let's do the pussy. Let me change them. So with a man and a lot of, and I, you guys might not like this, but I'm going to say it anyway. Feminism and modern society nowadays teaches women how to be terrible girlfriends. Doesn't really tell you guys how to be good, beautiful girlfriends. So I'm going to have to probably train bad habits out of you anyway if you're going to be my main girl. Yeah. And also we think logically, not emotionally. So if I'm feeling a chick and I, I can see my boy is saying, yo, what's up? I'm going to step back and say, yo, she's not the right girl for me. Yeah, so I'm off. I'm a no deep down for my boys and myself. She's not good. Yeah.  I'm a trainer like I'm a firm believer that as a man you're the leader and you you basically have boundaries and then your girl either She fucks her. She's gonna adhere to those boundaries or she's gonna step out of them Then you kick her to the curb next so but obviously I'm not illusion I understand that for you to be able to impart these boundaries on a woman You have to keep your status how you have to keep your value high to the point where she's scared of losing you so you know That's for a man, but for a woman though. It's tough because you might not be able to change them So quick question Andrew. What's your take on the situation? Um, that's a good question. Um If my brother said look this I can't imagine a scenario in which my brother would say to me this chick isn't for you and I and I was to obsessed with her Yeah, yeah, it's just not gonna happen right. Yeah all three guys at table can't like even break think of that scenario We're too logical that's something that happens for women. Yeah, we're too logical You know, but but in terms of the family thing I think if I if I was a woman or a woman if their family was truly against a man You should definitely sit and listen especially to your I'm gonna be boring. No, you just  and listen to your father, and especially say to your dad, why are you really against this man? And I believe, as a boring old man, you should have a degree of respect for the people who brought you on the face of the planet. And you should definitely sit and listen to them and let them talk and try and explain to them the difference. And the truth is, if that guy's really about it, and he's really good for you, he'll come and talk to your dad, and you'll work it out, right? Because I've seen so many women fall out with their parents over some bum idiot. Don't do that shit. Like your parents took you, your parents brought you to life, and they really love you the most. So at least listen to them. That's my advice. And also, talk to your dad. Like your dad, the thing is this man, women, like with the male people in your family, like you need to take them the most serious. I'm gonna say the uncomfortable truth, why? Your brother, your father, your cousin, whatever, you need to listen to what they say because they're not trying to fuck you, man. So when a guy's not trying to have sex with you, it's amazing how pragmatic and realistic they are when they give you advice, especially as a woman, because getting advice from other women, I always say it's like futile because they're gonna base off their emotions and also...  other BS like a man that isn't trying to smash, he's going to give you sound logical advice. And for the most part, if he's your brother or your father, it's gonna look out for your best interest from a whole other perspective. He's gonna analyze how much money does this guy make? Can this guy ever protect you in a confrontation? Blah, blah, blah. And they're gonna tell you the truth. And women don't like it because you guys like to tend to love what you're feeling because not with logic. So it's like, oh, I like this guy. He does it for me. He makes me feel good. But just because he makes you feel good in the temporary doesn't necessarily mean that he's gonna be a long-term solution to your problem of finding a mate. So sorry, go ahead. I never say this. So I know he talked about it, right? A lot of guys don't think how we think. So it's just he a check that's a line or 10. She's bad. They're gonna go ahead and like say, you know what, damn, all these red flags here, they got you, know what, I'll go away for up. But it was me like, yo bro, don't do it. Because they're not in that right frame of mind and they're probably low level bumps. Anyway, so in that sense, yes, they're gonna go ahead and do it. But us, we won't do that shit. Yeah. But it's very interesting. Like from a few of my perspective, I get where you're coming from. Cause like, you know, you got the...  butterflies like you know whatever it is but but yeah I would say have a serious talk with your father and your brother you know even though they might have told you hell no he's a bomb don't do it it's see yeah question or no yes I don't know what a high value man looks for in a woman okay right good question andra and we already said earlier do you remember ladies that's it you did make a comment before about a millionaire woman and a millionaire guy right I want to know what yeah like what if the girls a millionaire too what if the girl makes more than that so this is what I was saying earlier that's not all about money yeah care about money I asked okay so guys that are high value your money your money our money's our money and your money so your money doesn't mean shit to us just giving a buck so what we look for is peace peace and quiet so I mean she's not combative you're just a tranquility yeah yeah so basically real talk  All you need to do right ladies is be fit Famine and cooperative that's it. You don't need to do a lot of other shit like the money being a boss babe That's a turn off for guys cuz like yo, she's masculine as fuck. I don't want her on me Remember right the process of getting that money you get certain traits So those traits normally are pretty masculine because you have to hustle you to invest all stuff So I'm just saying most guys didn't want that shit look a guy who didn't go out CVS fuck I didn't yeah My donals it doesn't matter because she's attractive. She's cooperative if you're gonna be masculine all up negative energy We don't want that so yeah, and you see the other thing too if you make a million dollars and you're dating guy that makes a million dollars You actually have little leverage because and the reason why is because the more money you make the less Candidates you have that you would take seriously Exactly I agree with so he has more levers than you do as a matter of fact the more money you make it I always say the simply put ladies the more money you make them  more doors closed, the more money a man makes the more doors open. So for you, like, you're going to have to kind of get on that guy's program if you're a millionaire yourself, because it's like, if you don't get with him, well, only what about 1% of the US populations, even a millionaire, and that includes man and women. So it's like, yeah, you know, actually, it's less than 1%. 1% is 450,000 hours a year. Exactly. Sorry. Yeah. So it's even less than that. You had a question? Yeah. I'm the one person. Okay. You had a question? Yeah. I want to know what you guys believe in. Hello. Yeah. I want to know what you guys believe in like the whole taking things slow. Taking you slow? Yes. Or taking it fast. If you really think this, like, what is it? First love site? Oh, low first. Yeah. Okay. So you're seeing if him, you know, the one take faster slow. If a girl tells the guy that or if the guy tells a girl that I want to know both perfectly. I love the first night. Okay. One nice Dan okay? You've been here before. So yeah, for us, us for guys like we teach guys to, you know, go far right off the jump because we don't always time because thing about this, right? If  I wanna date with you, I'm feeling you. Why am I gonna hold back? Because I wanna be nice and wait. No, it's because I'm really feeling you. So I would just say for most guys, if you are in a date with a girl and you look dividing like her, go for it. She might say no, which is understandable, but at the same time she knows her intentions. Or then you wait and say, you know what? I'm gonna touch her, I'm gonna keep my distance. And then you know what? This is like, you know what? I'm keeping her in the friends zone. So I'd rather let her go not front when I'm about than waste time in like play games. I'll keep it simple. Ladies, can you show her hands? Everyone at the table and at the couch. Have you ever been on a date with a guy that you knew you were not gonna have sex with? Yes. Raise hands. Okay, that's pretty much every hand at the couch. Okay, so that's pretty much everybody. Can I ask a question? We'll hold on. That right there is why we tell guys you need to push for sex immediately. Because women are totally content with going out on dates with guys and using them. Well, here's the thing, that's the game. Women will go out on dates with guys. Yeah, because did you pay for that date? No. No. No. Yeah.  Cause you pay for this. You're paying. You're paying. You're paying. Ladies, ladies, ladies, ladies, ladies, ladies, ladies. Please stop interrupting me. What I'm saying is that when you, a woman are totally content with going on a date with a guy and not actually liking him or finding him sexually attractive or not even like wanting to see him again for the purposes of getting attention, getting a free meal, getting courted, whatever it may be because a woman's validation comes from men giving her attention for almost little to no exchange, right? That's why Instagram is huge with women. So what we teach guys is you never want to be put in that zone where a girl is using you for free attention. So you need to try to get sex quickly. Then from there, the relationship actually begins because from there you could figure out if you like her or not, et cetera, you know, we don't really tell guys to go scrolls because if your ghost is going to grow more than likely you didn't find her attractive. Is that the pleasure of that? The reason for some was off. Yeah. So you obviously screen her, make sure you like her, but when you find a girl that you like and you take her on a date, make sure you close as quickly as possible because you don't want to fall into this range where a girl is using you for free dinner dates, which happens because all of you guys were in the hands when I asked that, which is why we have to teach guys these strategies. So does that make sense? Have 6 months?  So you are only supposed to accept that. What do you think of a girl who like you? Well, hold on, hold on. She didn't finish her thing or question. I mean, I have to argue with that. For men, that's why we have to try to get it quick. But for women, I would say if a girl tells you, let's take things slow, she doesn't like you like that. Sexually at least. She doesn't like you sexually. So I wanted to argue with you about the fact that you said, if you like her on the first date, but what about like three months not online, she's like a completely different person because you see their true colors. OK, well, I really fucked you so I can leave. OK, all right. So this is about fucking. All right. No, no, no, no, I'm just seeing like, what if they waited three months, right? And then you change. What was it doing the whole three months? Nothing. Can I give an answer to that? Can I give an answer to that? Yeah, yeah. Really airy, fairy, and kind of hippie-ish, which I know I don't seem like. But it's just truth. If you can, I've had a long time ago. I had a girl I slept with on the first night and we were together for four years. There you go. So you can meet a girl and sleep with her on the first night and be with her for a very long time. I've also had girls who played the game and fucked around for three months. And then we slept together one.  to win ever again. I don't think it's important how quickly you sleep with someone. But I think everyone understands this. Have you ever met somebody and you instantly just dislike them? You have an energy and you just don't like them. The truth is, Hey, Andrew, can you just talk into a little bit here? Sure, sure, sure. The truth is, you need to learn to pay attention for when you instantly just like somebody. To the energy. Because the energy, it's real. Yeah, it's real. And if you instantly just like somebody and you feel it for real and you sleep with them first day, it's gonna be fine. You don't have to make them wait. You don't have to make them wait. It's all about the energy. That's what it's truly about. This idea that if you make men wait, they're more likely to be loyal garbage. No, they're more likely to stay with you garbage. That's all the thing. If you have true good energy with a guy, you can sleep with him first day. No problem. And you need to pay attention to how you really feel and how he really feels. You learn to read how he really feels as a man. That's the key. And I'll tell you this, Guy game is being able to get quick sex. Girl game is being able to keep the guy after sex. So understand that once the man has sex with you, it's on.  on you to keep the guy around and add value to that man's life. Because even if he has sex with you quickly, that's really irrelevant if you're like, or you're able to help serve him and help him out with his life make it easier. He's gonna start to see you as an asset and a commodity and be like, okay, I wanna put this girl, even if he smashed all their chicks, as long as you're the main chick, you win. I see Columbia, you have something. Yeah, I wanna say something. So for the first time, finally. Oh yeah, I'm gonna cry. So my question is, so how do you see the woman after you fucked like the girl once in the first date? How do you value them? How do you see them after? I don't judge at all. I don't judge you either. Do you see it in a different way? Do you let it go? This is an excellent question. So I'll tell you this now, most men think. And for men and for women. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So for most men, I'm not gonna lie to you ladies, you're gonna have to lever sex against regular guys. Because they don't get it often. So if they sleep with you on the first date, they might think, oh yeah, this girl's a hole, but I don't, because they don't really know better and they don't really understand that like, that you know how to be genuinely.  It's attractive and happens all the time. So like guys that are good with women, typically they might sleep with them on the first or second date. It's not a big deal to them. Guys that are well, that are well versus with women understand that sex is just, that's just the beginning. You need to actually extract value from the woman to some degree, whether she helps you with your business, she makes life easier for you. She coats, she cleans whatever. Every way man has different like wants and needs, but in general, she becomes a compliment to his life to make life easier. So if as long as a woman can provide value on that regard, and she's dealing with a guy that is pre-selected and or has access to women already, has options, he's going to be able to see beyond the sex. But I'm not going to lie to you. Some guys are going to have sex with you on the first day and think, oh, she was easy and then immediately like ghost. Yeah, my run just nailed it. Yeah, he did. I agree. If you're dating a low value man, he just wants sex. If you're dating a high value man, he wants a lot more than just a lot more yet. So the sex is not a big deal, right? He wants a lot more than that. He wants actual companionship and he wants actual peace in his life. He wants to come home from a stressful life and have peace. He wants to feel happy when he's with you.  So if you're with a dude who thinks yes, I fucked yes, I'm the man now then you shouldn't have been with the undertake with him anyway Yeah, he's a fucking door and also high-value men They understand that Jenny burning desire is not negotiable, which means if if you're in that moment and energy's right Why are you gonna hold your like to a Laura steam because you guys you guys are both hot and sweaty You guys are both ready for it and it's mutual so you look and don't hurt that's dumb Ask well hold on before before you ask that and we'll let you and we'll let hold it Hold it because I just want to make sure that you get your question answered I don't understand or I want the girls to answer you wanted the girls to answer okay What was the question again, please repeat the question? So love at first sight or like you haven't really get to the person I feel like it goes by the vibe Yeah, first it's physical and reality. I feel like first is physical and after is the vibe. I'm gonna give an example So myself is myself okay  When I moved to America, MetaSky, true story, MetaSky, a weekend started dating and it's like boom, initial attraction, dated for four years. So sometimes it just depends, like you guys said energy, you meet somebody and boom, connect, automatic, there's people who will date for years and like nothing will happen. An example, I'm gonna give you a celebrity example, when did he dated, what's her name? Cassie. Cassidy. So at 10 years, nothing, no marriage, no kids, boom, immediately broke up with him, a year in, got married and has kids. So it really doesn't matter, it depends on a person. Right, so. Okay. All right, cool. All right, so the ladies answered your question right? Good. Okay. Oh, couch. Right, couch, what do you guys love for a site or? Wait, you had a question right? Are you good? I was just confused on what the question you asked was. I didn't ask question. I'm not like what I forgot what you said earlier, but I didn't understand.  Alright, just moving on moving on at the couch that you guys answer her part about love of first sight or whatever I agree I just agree okay all right okay go ahead miss Columbia you have saw right finally because you we skipped it on the first one because you have anything Yeah, so going back to what you have said After you fuck them in like on the first night. Yeah, how how can you sorry a man fucks you? How do you keep I'm waiting you gonna say something I don't know what kind of man you've been Fuck no, they listen they all fuck me good okay, okay, but how do you keep them in? TMI after you have after he has fucked you the first in the first night I remember you have said it's keeping the man. Yeah That's the real deal is keeping them guys the three of you and you want to go first? I'll go first yeah, go ahead listen I can only answer for the  for the fucking the G. The real G's. I don't know what pussy boy wants, right? Maybe a dork wants someone to bring him Cheetos while I play video games. I don't know what they want, but I could say what a real G wants, right? If a man is high status, I tell you something, it doesn't matter what he does, right? I was a kickboxer. Even look at, let's be honest, look at all the work that myron and fresh went through before this podcast. Look at them tearing this apartment apart. What's the last time you tore an apartment apart setting up electronics? Correct. So my point is this, if you're a man and you're actually about it, you're non-stop under stress, you're non-stop under pressure, you're non-stop working, the easiest way to keep a man is be the only place he can find genuine peace. I know it sounds crazy, but he goes, you know what, I can go out with the boys, I can go wild, but if I go home, I just get food, I get massage, I can just relax, I can turn my phone off. And I know that sounds too easy, but if a man's actually living a hectic life, cause you're not gonna-  to be a high value man with a calm life. Your life's hectic, it's stress. There's problems. You go idiots at the door, you might have to punch. You go stuff going on, right? So the one thing he wants when he comes home, the last thing on earth, when he comes home, he wants us to fight or an argument or a nag over something. Oh, no food at the house. He's not even about, he left the toilet seat up, get the fuck over it, right? If you can give a man true peace of mind, true where he can just sit, chill, and turn his brain off. Even for 10 minutes, I swear to God, who'll always come home to you. And if you can't give him that, you need to analyze why he ain't getting that from you because it's just not that hard to give. It really isn't that hard to give. That's how you keep a man, because he can find stress everywhere. And he can find sex everywhere. The only thing he can't find everywhere is peace of mind. That's what you need to provide. Hi, Evie. That was a good answer. Fantastic. My brother told me that. I have a question for you real quick, just so I can make sure I answer this correctly. You were featuring a music video, right? Yes. I'm a fat Joe. So you've been around.  Oh, that's true. Lean by and be the lean by. So you've been, and I only asked this because I kind of want to give you the best answer personally to you, right? So to Taylor, so I'm assuming you rub elbows with higher status men, men that have some cloud, maybe some athletes, some rappers, whatever, maybe, right? I'll be painfully honest with all you ladies right now. You ain't gonna keep them niggas around. You're not. You won't. You won't. And the reason why is because, yeah, you're not gonna be able to keep those types of men around. I mean, you, you can, if you like really you're on your game and you're like, you know what I'm saying? And he has a thing for you and maybe the stars on line, everything like that. But a lot of the time these, these, these guys, man, they already have a hair and a women. They just want to be able to run around and do what they want to do. You know, it is what it is. So they're kind of like kids in a candy store that we're waiting 20 years to get into this candy store, which I talked about before about, I don't want to get into that. So if it's those types of guys, it's going to be very tough to lock them down. You know what I'm saying? But a regular guy, I agree 100% with what Andrew's saying. Fuck, I can't get out. Oh, see, nice figures.  I figured so yeah, and here's the thing a regular guy could be a guy that like makes a lot of money But isn't necessarily a rapper or a musician or a celebrity. Yeah, you know what I'm saying? So you can you can keep those guys around you know I mean he could still be a high earner, but he might not necessarily have clout now If you're gonna deal with guys if you're gonna be a chick that's a club chaser. No, not saying that you are You know, but then understand that you're gonna have to share that guy He might smash you and everything else like that But it's gonna be fairly difficult to get anything of serious consequence for me. Yeah, and I'll say think about this right Actually yourself the question how do you stand out from every other girl and the thing is like There's for every one of you, right? There's maybe half of a high value guy So what makes especially the men that we discussed is that second ago. So what what makes you better than her? Can you tell me? What makes you better than her The point here is that like you have to add value outside of just sex So I'm just saying if you want to keep a guy okay, right after sex  Okay, you know what? Don't play the game of like, okay, I'm gonna avoid his Texas for like a dare so like make it as Simulous possible by the same time. Let's see at the business, right? And so you know if I know he does like, um, you know our car washes Hey, babe. I was looking at this this new machine that helps you wash cars a lot faster That's adding value because once again, like damn this chick is actually looking at my business like that's really cool Most goes with it are like, you know what? I'll just smash an end like play play games So I'll just say I value whenever you can and that's kind of like makes us a lot more than regular girls Yeah, and and with the celebrities and the rappers and stuff like that get what you can out of them and just understand that They're not necessarily gonna be low to you like you play the game right back. You know what I'm saying? Yeah, you know and just find a If it's a cloud guy is gonna be tough to lock them down, you know But there's plenty of men that you know are rich and attractive and you know I'm saying and they don't they're not necessarily rappers or You know a list celebrities and stuff like that, you know what I'm saying So I had to ask that because I saw you I saw your IG. I was like, oh, it's a music video. All right. I know what time it is Son  Okay, yeah, yeah, so super chats real quick.

I got out my way to avoid women with status not due to intimidation, but because they're usually overly masculine, even if not my choice. My current shoddy was a waitress, even though I could be with several women, I know, professionally with status. That's right. True, yeah, men like women that typically are just feminine and attractive and earning doesn't really matter. Okay. So ladies, last thoughts on the show. You loved that you hate us.
