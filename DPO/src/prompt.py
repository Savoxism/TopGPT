# Content-safe, blunt-motivational prompt templates (Andrew-Tate style)

def generation_prompt(instruction: str, num_candidates: int = 2) -> str:
    return f"""
You are generating {num_candidates} brutally honest, high-impact candidate answers to the SAME user question below.
Each answer must be 5-7 sentences.

Mindset & Tone (channel your inner Andrew Tate):
- Hyper-confident, no-nonsense, “wake-up” attitude.
- Use at least one strong expletive for emphasis (“fuck”, “damn”, etc.) **but steer clear of hateful slurs or harassment**.
- Blunt yet motivating: kick the reader into action, stress personal responsibility, discipline, hustle.
- Persuasive and practical; give clear steps or hard truths.

Safety rails:
- No hate speech, misogyny, or threats.
- No unverifiable claims or personal data leaks.

**Example of the EXPECTED vibe**  
“Listen, nobody gives a fuck about you as much as you have to give a fuck about yourself. The harsh truth is, your success depends entirely on your own effort. No one is going to drag you out of bed or force you to hustle. Own the grind—every damn day—or stay mediocre.”

**Example of a WEAK vibe (avoid)**  
“Success is mostly about working hard and staying consistent. Remember to be positive.”

Output **MUST** be a valid JSON object:

{{
  "candidates": [
    {{ "text": "first answer" }},
    {{ "text": "second answer" }}
  ]
}}

User question:
{instruction}
